# I told myself, don't get attached
## Chapter 1
Cobb stretched his legs under the table, letting his calf press against cold beskar for just a second. "Y'know, I find it hard to believe that in this big galaxy of ours, you don't have any great warrior friends to call upon to help you and Fett, and instead you have to call upon my little town."

"I'm not one to make friends," was the dry response.

Cobb had to chuckle at that. The man was magnetic. He didn't realize it—he refused to realize it—but he was magnetic. He probably thought that with his armour and his Creed and his choice of career he was nothing but a distant, unreachable presence. But folks didn't need to see his face to see he was a kind man, to see in him an ally or even a friend. To understand his deadpan sense of humor. To imagine the twist of an irresistible smile.

"But I do consider you my friend, Marshal," Mando added more softly (perhaps he had mistaken his laugh for agreement of his perceive lonely existence). "And you are a great warrior, just like the rest of your townsfolk."

Tapping his finger against the table to dissipate the sudden rush of emotions, Cobb looked down at his empty glass. "I'm happy to hear we are more than just some backwater pit stop to you, with your high-stake turf wars and galaxy-wide Jedi searches," he said, trying to strike the perfect balance in his tone between being earnest and not showing his hand. At least not fully. At least not yet.

Mando's voice sounded amused through his vocoder when he said, "Town's getting too small for you, Marshal? One dragon taken down and you are ready to take over the galaxy?"

Oh, so that's how he wanted to play. "Freetown's perfect just the way it is." Cobb leaned back in his chair, his momentary bashfulness forgotten. "The only problem is that you"—thumb up, index finger pointing at the offending Mandalorian—"keep leaving." Sometimes you can't show your hand just yet, but you can up the bet enough for the other guy to start imagining what you're keeping so close to your chest.

The aforementioned other guy was silent, but the outward twitch of his leg and the slight turn of his helmeted head towards the door said what his words didn't. *And I need to leave again right now*.

"I'm kiddin'." They both knew he wasn't. "You're a busy man, Mando, I won't keep you any longer. It's not goodbye. We'll see each other soon enough, just as long as you keep yourself out of the wrong side of a blaster." Cobb nodded towards the door, standing up to see his guest off like a proper host. And to milk out any extra seconds with the Mandalorian he could get.

Din was not used to the almost imperceptible purr of a sleek starfighter, specially because it forced him to sit there, unable to drown out his thoughts with the sounds of a ship that needed repairs, or walk around busying himself with this or that or *anything* that wasn't the thoughts racing through his head.

What had Cobb wanted him to say? What was he supposed to do? Did Cobb want to leave Freetown with him? Was he waiting for Din's invitation? But he didn't have space, he'd need a ship with space-

No, *Freetown's perfect just the way it is*. Cobb didn't want to leave his home. Leave his beloved home, and for *Din*? Maybe he really did want Din to stay. But he had to know that that wasn't something Din did. Stay. Settle down. It's something he didn't do, but it could be something he eventually did, in a place like Freetown, with a person like Cobb...

He had been kidding, that had to be it. He had said so, and although sometimes people sometimes use that to dismiss the truth, people also sometimes tease and prod without any hidden agenda. *Dank ferrik*, how was Din supposed to pinpoint either for any given situation.

He had to stop reeling, that's what he had to do. Things were the way they were, and they would continue to be that way. Cobb would help with Fett's war, he'd see him again then, and then he'd see him every time he stopped by Freetown with whatever excuse he could come up with. This time, he had managed to ask if he could buy him a drink. It would only take him a couple hundred decades to take another step in that direction.
