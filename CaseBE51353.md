# Case #BE51353

Statement of Paul Hansen, regarding the creature trapped in Roderick Burgess's basement. Statement originally written in a sealed letter found in Mr. Hansen's desk by his son after his death, and brought to the Institute on June 3rd, 1962. Original statement undated. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

I write this as a testimonial and as a confessional, yet one I will never turn in to the appropriate authorities, if there are any. I do not believe I acted in any way that I am ashamed of, nor do I have deluded fantasies of what I would've done differently. I had a job, and I did it, and I am certain that I did not hurt any people while doing it.

That _thing_ was not a person.

I'd read about Roderick Burgess in the papers more than once. Eccentric rich bastard does this public appearance, throws that lavish party, things like that. Mostly pieces for the social page, no actual news.

The job, though, did not come from the papers, or from any of the agencies I had worked with in the past. This was the kind of job you could only get by recommendation of someone already on the inside. It's not unusual for the rich sort to be meticulous when hiring security, so when an old partner contacted me about a job opening at Fawney Rig, but said that he was not at liberty to share any details, I was not fazed in the slightest.

The opening turned out to be my old partner's spot. He had been working there for years and was ready for an early retirement. The money you got for working at Fawney Rig allowed for that sort of luxury. Even with the personal recommendation of such a stellar employee, my screening process still took months. This was still not surprising. They didn't want any overexcited rookie coming aboard, mouth watering at the juicy paycheck, I thought.

Looking back, I don't think they payed enough, not for what they put you through.
