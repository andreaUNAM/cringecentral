## Chapter 1

Hob had written a speech. At one point, he had sat down and he had written an honest-to-God speech. He had already bought himself one of those new IBM personal computers, but he hadn't developed the habit of using it, so pen and paper it was. He had grabbed pen and paper and had written down everything he was going to tell His Stranger when—no, _if_—no, _when_ he decided to show his face again.

He had started his speech with an apology about the lack of tact from his part. He had meant what he had said, sure, but he could've said it better. Then he had added a quip or two about how rude it was to leave _an acquaintance_ hanging without even a note to say he'd miss their meeting. He had a mobile phone now, too, if he wanted to call. And a pager. Then those "quips" had evolved into ranting about how he's _oh so sorry_ that his pride had been wounded, but that's no excuse to be an absolute piece of shit with no regard for the feelings of others, and if he thought he could just waltz back into Hob's life like nothing had happened, he had another thing coming. Then that already barely coherent rant had evolved into a string of curses and smudged ink. Hob had been very drunk at the time.

God knows where that written speech was now, and at one point he had even decided that, when the moment came, he wouldn't say a single damn thing. Let the bastard do all the talking, if Hob even deigned to acknowledge his presence.

The moment came. Tugged by the strings of Fate, Hob lifted his gaze up from the papers he was grading and there he was, his choice of goth outfit for this century consisting of a long black coat over a black shirt and black skinny jeans. His hair was a fucking mess, and there was something about the look on his face. Serious, sure, but not stern and pinched like it had been during previous meetings. There wasn't a shadow of proud arrogance that expected Hob to fall to his knees and beg for forgiveness for his imprudence. In fact, he looked hesitant.

All of Hob's resolve vanished in an instant. He smiled, he couldn't help himself. He could be headstrong in many other moments of his life; he could allow himself to have one weakness, one tall, pale, angular Achilles heel. "You're late."

Dear stars above, was that a smile he got in response? And the quietest of chuckles? "**It seems I owe you an apology. I've always heard it impolite to keep one's friends waiting.**"

And that was it for Robert Gadling. A meteorite could fall right outside the New Inn and he wouldn't even notice. He felt a new smile, wider and brighter, spread across his face as his friend, his _friend_, sat down across from him. And he did so in a way that was so uncharacteristically relaxed that Hob couldn't help but relax, too, easing back into the seat, fingers toying with his glass of beer.

(There was a small part of him that kept prodding, that growled lowly like a caged beast. That was it? An apology, sure, but no explanation? 33 years of heartbreak and alcohol, and no explanation? 133 years, if he counted the ones he'd been in denial. He did his best to ignore that part of himself.)

"Do you, uh..." Hob cleared his throat. "Do you want anything to drink?"

His Stranger still had a smile on his lips, somehow, impossibly. "**Just wine, thank you. Red.**" Now this dance he knew. He'd have a wineglass in front of him, almost as if he wanted to complete the human ritual of "being in a pub", but he'd never touch it. Hob could deal with such a familiar thing. He flagged down the waitress (Wendy, sociology student, 3<sup>rd</sup> year) and placed the order for his friend (_his friend_!). Why he made sure to order a good one when it would go untouched, he didn't know.

Then there was silence, and even with the beast inside of Hob, it felt comfortable. He knew he was going to be the one to break it. He'd start prattling about the past century (plus some years, 33, who was counting), and his friend would remain silent, listening to whatever bullshit Hob had to say. That was what he knew, what was familiar, but today was apparently opposite day, or "Fuck with Hob's perception of reality" day, because his friend spoke first.

"**Dream.**" A pause, long enough for Hob to wonder what the fuck was going on. "**Or Morpheus. Oneiros. Kai'ckul. Sandman. Take your pick.**"

"My... my pick?" There was something deep, deep, deep, deep, _deep_ inside of Hob whispering that he knew exactly what was happening, but he chose to ignore it because he didn't believe it. Whatever was happening was not what Hob thought (_hoped_) was happening. "O-Of what, exactly?"

The smile was a smirk now; the bastard was doing it on purpose. "**My name,**" he said simply, like he didn't know he was dumping a bucket of cold water on Hob's head. "**I could offer more.**"

Oh. So what was happening was what Hob had thought was happening. Okay. _This_ was happening. He was getting a name. Name<em>s</em>, plural. And he could take his pick, if he wanted to. He didn't want to. That wasn't his choice to make. He took a swig of beer for courage. "Which one do you want me to use?"

There was a millisecond of surprise in the other's expression. He quickly schooled it, though, and replied, "**Dream.**"

"Dream."

"**Dream of the Endless.**"

"Dream _of the Endless_? Tad dramatic, don't you think?"

"**I _am_ endless.**"

And what the _fuck_ do you answer to that. If you're Hob Gadling, you down the rest of your beer and mutter, "Aren't we all, brother." That got him a laugh. And it was wonderful.

"**Such insolence, thinking that just by being immortal you can call yourself one of us,**" Dream said, and his tone was playful. It was clear that he was joking, and yet... "**_one such as I_**"... The wording wasn't even that similar. Hob would've brushed it off as his nerves getting the better of him, if it wasn't for the way Dream immediately pressed his lips into a tight line and looked away. So. He'd heard it, too.

Wendy, bless her heart, chose that moment to set down Dream's drink. It should've been a tiny break in the tension, gone before Hob could take advantage of it to change the topic. That's what it should've been. By now, it was settled that today was not the day for "should've"s or "known"s or "familiar"s.

Dream took a sip.

He took the wineglass by the stem with fingers that looked even more fragile than the stem itself, swirled its contents around, sniffed it, and took a small sip.

What. The _ever-loving_ fuck was going on.

Dream was looking down at the crimson wine, watching it lap at the sides of the glass. When he spoke, Hob was sure he was speaking to himself, not even realizing he was speaking out loud. "**It's always the little things you miss.**"

And here comes Hob Gadling, Britain's undefeated champion at the art of putting his fucking foot in his mouth. "Am I a little thing?" The cheeky comment slipped out unchecked. Fuck. Here's to another 133 years of regret.

Dream's hand froze so abruptly that the wine sloshed and threatened to spill out of the glass. When he lifted his gaze to meet Hob's, there was steely determination in them. Not anger, not wounded pride, but it still made Hob's stomach knot with anxiety. His voice sounded even deeper when he said, "**I wouldn't call you that, my friend, but I did miss you. Missed our meeting.**"

Hob felt his only beer of the night surge back up from his stomach up his throat, around his brain, behind his eyes, and all the way down to his feet. He was on cloud nine. He was heartbroken. He had forgiven Dream the moment he walked into the New Inn. He was angry. He was confused. The word "miss" all of a sudden had too many meanings. _Of course you missed our meeting, you stupid bastard, you_ weren't there. _But did you also ache at the lack of it, from wherever you were, nursing your wounded pride and letting me stew in my pain for an extra 33 years?_ Hob closed his eyes (a feeble attempt at keeping his tears in check) before managing to push out two words. "Then why...?"

"**I know I owe you an explanation.**"

And then there was silence. Not a pause, not a buildup towards an explanation. Silence. Of course. Hob rubbed his eyes and let out a pitiful excuse for a laugh. So much for a straightforward answer. Like herding fucking cats...

"**I was captured and imprisoned.**"

Hob's eyes flew open. It was like a switch was flipped inside him. All of his pain, his self-pity, his anger at Dream, all of it flocked together into a single razor-sharp blade of anger pointed at a new nameless enemy. "Who?" he growled.

"**Hob...**"

"_Who?"_

"**They've all been dealt with.**"

"Good." Hob would never call himself a good man, and not wishing ill upon others was a rule of good men. He wished that whatever way they had been dealt with had been tenfold whatever suffering they'd put Dream through.

Dream's gaze was stern again when he reiterated his previous statement. "**It really did pain me to miss our last meeting, specially considering the way we parted in our meeting before that.**"

Another sad little laugh. "Yeah, I think that 30-plus years of imprisonment absolves you from that, dear heart." He'd never called him that before. Why was he calling him that? Why was he so keen in testing the limits today until he screwed everything up again? What would Dream-

"**A century. I was there for a century.**"

Hob thought he was going to fall off his chair with the wave of nausea that hit him. "Bloody _hell_, Dream." He steadied himself. "Are you okay?" Dream's eyes were suddenly elsewhere. Of course he wasn't okay. What a stupid question. To make up for it, Hob stepped up his game with a stupid action: he reached across the table and squeezed Dream's hand. "I'm here for whatever you need," he said softly.

The universe stopped dead in its tracks. Dream looked down at where Hob's hand was still on his own. Hob had the very foreign feeling that he was about to die.

Dream placed his other hand on top of Hob's. "**Thank you, my friend.**"

Hob had the very foreign feeling that he was being born again into a whole new world.

## Chapter 2

The moment ended a handful of seconds after it started, but it was enough for Hob to commit to memory how every inch of his skin that was in contact with Dream's felt. It hadn't been a brusque separation, either. Dream simply eased back into his chair, taking his hands with him. Pity. Hob didn't move his hand for a while, just in case.

"—and yeah, it's slowly becoming a state of constant surveillance, your vacuum cleaner contains a detailed floor plan of your home, it's all gonna come back to bite us in the arse sooner rather than later, but hey! We said the same thing about electrical lights, didn't we? Well, yeah, it might be worse this time around, but look at this! Once upon a time, you felt any sort of physical ailment and they'd stick a leech on you and call it a day. Now, a fucken shiny square is telling me to go for a walk before the day ends to reach my daily step goal!" A sweeping gesture at his watch. "I swear, this thing is going to have an artificial existencial crisis when the years pass and my heartbeat never stops. That is, if the damned things were built to last. I've had breeches that lasted longer than one of my new phones."

He had been rambling about the past century for quite some time now. It was dark outside (yeah, his watch was going to be angry at him about the step goal, but Dream took priority. Over everything.). He had three empty beer glasses in front of him, and in front of Dream was an empty wineglass. Hob hadn't even suggested he get a second; he didn't want to push the amount of miracles that could happen in one day.

He placed both hands on the table, leaned back, and caught his breath. He wasn't sure when he had adopted those series of gestures to end a rant, but he knew that his students recognized them as the signal to hit "Stop" on their phone's stopwatch. The little bastards timed him. He knew there was a spreadsheet somewhere with a detailed account of his personal records. Cheeky fuckers. He loved them so much. "So..." He had no idea what he wanted to say next. If this were one of their previous meetings, that would be it, after his recount of the century. Well. No. There was one more thing missing, if they were going to dance their usual dance. "Aren't you going to ask me?"

Dream furrowed his brow minutely as he processed the question, but when he understood, his little smirk was very similar to the one from right after the Constantine incident. Oh, how Hob loved that smirk. "**Hadn't we agreed that it was pointless for me to ask by now?**"

"Come on! For the sake of tradition, my friend!"

Dream's sigh carried frustration and affection in equal quantities. And a whole lot of theatrics. "**Fine.**" He eyed Hob like one eyes an annoying little pet who demands treats. "**Robert Gadling. Do you still wish to live?**"

Hob knew the question was coming. He had asked for it, for fuck's sake. He knew his answer; it had not changed in six hundred years. A three-letter word would suffice. But _no_. His reaction was a pair of fingerguns and "You know it, baby."

Why? Why the _fuck_ did he do that? Why the fuck did he _say_ that?

Dream was staring at him with a blank expression. Time to holster those guns, partner. "That..." Hob cleared his throat. "That means yes."

And Dream laughed. A huff of sound escaped his lips, and he placed a loose fist over it to hide it, but his eyes shone with mirth. "**You are insufferable,**" he said, and Hob felt himself drown in the affection those words carried.

Hob was tugging at his earlobe again, damned little tick. "Eh, you only have to deal with me once a century."

Dream glanced down at his empty wineglass, traced its edge with a pale finger once, twice, thrice, and raised his eyes to Hob again. "**Friends meet more often than centennially, yes?**"

Hob's throat felt dry. A fourth beer was sounding quite enticing all of a sudden. Tread very carefully, Gadling. "Friends do, yes," he stammered.

Dream nodded slowly. "**Then I shall do my best to come visit you soon, dear friend.**" He stood up, and then this man, god, _being_ awarded Hob one last miracle: "**Shall I walk you home?**" Dream's lips twisted into a playful little smile. "**To appease your _square_?**"

Well, that sounded just lovely, except— "I live upstairs, mate," Hob replied with a sheepish grin, and Dream looked positively shocked, his mouth a perfect "o". "Yeah, it was the easiest solution, I already owned the land, couldn't be arsed to deal with even more real estate."

"**You own... this land?**"

Hob was able to divert his hand before it tugged at his earlobe yet again, running it through his hair instead. "Yup. Spotted it, bought it, had the New Inn built on top of it," he said. _For you,_ he didn't say.

_For me,_ Dream's shocked faced seemed to say. "**I-**"

Hob couldn't bear to hear whatever was going to come after in that sentence. "You can walk me to the stairs," he cut in, pointing to the door next to the bar.

This day had been so bizarre that when Dream's shocked expression morphed into a smile, normalcy was restored into the world. "**Lead the way**," he said with a tilt of the head that was almost a bow, if one such as Dream of the Endless would ever bow to one such as Hob Gadling.

## Chapter 3

When Dream had said he'd try to visit him sooner than 2089, Hob expected to see him in 50 years, turning their meetings into a semicentennial occurrence and patting himself in the back for doing such a good job at playing the part of normal friend. Instead, Dream showed up at his office a little more than a month later.

Hob, as seemed to be his custom, started talking before he was done thinking. "How did you know where— right, Endless, whatever, don't answer that, not that you were going to answer anyway."

Dream's rigid stance and expression were solemn as ever, but there was a hint of taunting in his voice when he said, "**"Hello, Dream. Good to see you, Dream. How have you been keeping, Dream?"**"

Hob pointed at him with a plastic fork that still held the cherry tomato he had been about to indulge in when he had sensed a pair of eyes (_that_ pair of eyes) watching him from the open doorway. "I don't know who taught you how to be funny, but I'd like to have a word with them. I don't think they realize the horrors they've unleashed into the world." He popped the tomato into his mouth before gesturing at the empty chair across his desk. "Close the door behind you, will you? This is technically my lunch break, but I like to keep an "all hours are office hours if you see my door open" policy for the kids, in case they need something."

After doing as he was asked, Dream slid into the offered chair. Once again, his posture was so at ease that Hob felt a sparkle of pride knowing his friend felt like he could relax around him. "**That honor would go to my older sister, I am afraid,**" he retorted to Hob's banter, "**if you want to take your complaints up to her.**"

Hob could've choked on the piece of lettuce he had just put in his mouth. He could've sputtered, freaked out, demanded more information, but he decided that no, he wasn't doing that today. "Right. You have a sister. Of course. Endless, too, I presume. Obviously. No doubt about it. Still no bleeding clue what any of that means, but live and let live, right?"

Dream tilted his head in a way that Hob would've called adorable if he were looking to get his tongue ripped out of his skull by a god. "**Has the ever-curious Hob Gadling run out of questions?**"

"The ever-patient Hob Gadling is done asking questions he won't receive an answer to, as a little bit of self-care, to adopt the sayings of the century."

"**I cannot wait to see how long _that_ lasts.**"

"Eat shit, mate." Dream's eyebrow climbed up a good inch, and Hob feared that he had gotten a bit too comfortable in their new comradery, but Dream didn't storm out. Look positively pissy, he did, but he stayed put, so Hob guessed he was in the clear. "Apologies. Eat shit, milord."

Dream pursed his lips. "**I wonder if knowledge about who I am would make you choose your words more carefully, but I fear that that is a lost cause.**"

As he put his now empty salad container back into his bag, Hob let out a dramatic sigh. "You could try, but I must warn you: I've already drawn up a pretty good picture of who you are with the names you gave me last time, and I'm still not very careful with what I say."

Dream's pissy mood uncoiled just a smidge. "**You've become quite a scholar, haven't you?**"

While the (almost) compliment was pleasant to receive, Hob felt it was his duty as liaison for humanity before Dream of the Endless to clarify a thing or two. "Mate," he began slowly, "I just needed to know how to google shit." He pulled his laptop closer from where he had pushed it aside to eat, opened a new browser tab and typed in "morpheus". He turned the laptop around so the screen was facing Dream. "There. From putting it all together, I figured you are some sort of god of sleep."

Without paying any attention to the screen (huh, Hob would've thought that in his vanity he'd love to read about himself), Dream let out a shallow laugh, "**A _god_.**" He sounded extremely amused, as if his good friend Hob were taking the piss by calling him such a lowly name. "**You think me so fleeting, Robert?**"

Well. Shit. Hob thought he had had a good guess there. Fuck him, apparently, for considering that his immortal, proud, powerful friend was something as meager as a _god_. "You said you were Endless," he answered stupidly.

"**And gods are not.**" Obviously. Gods? Endless? Ha! Laughable idea. "**And immortal human men...**" He let his words hang between them, a smirk on his lips.

Hob slammed his laptop shut, but any anger the action could convey was evaporated by his wide grin. "Fine, fine, I get it, we are all but shit beneath your Endless Doc Martens." Another tilt of the head. "Your boots." Damn him to Hell but he had been right, Hob couldn't help but be his usual curious self. "I yield. What, exactly, does it mean to be Endless?"

Dream, damn him to Hell and back, gave himself a moment to bask in his victory, and then he rearranged his long legs so that the ankle of one was resting on the knee of the other. "**You catch me in a good mood, my friend,**" he basically purred, and the contented sound combined with the knowledge that, despite everything, his friend could still have good moods made the corners of Hob's lips twitch. "**We of the Endless, for there are seven of us, predate your kind, your gods, and your world. I am the Lord of the Dreaming, Creator of Dreams, King of Nightmares, Shaper of Forms. I contain the entirety of the human unconsciousness. Whensoever you sleep, you enter the Dreaming. The Dreaming is me, and I am the Dreaming.**"

Hob was glad for his previous research because, as it was, he felt like his brain was melting into goo, even when he had already coached himself mentally to accept that his Stranger turned friend was a god. And then it turns out that "god" fell short of the mark, and that little speech...

"Christ's fingernails..." Now there's a phrase he hadn't used in a while. "So, uh-" Hob paused and swallowed, trying to find his voice, his real voice, not that pitchy excuse for a sound. "So you are Dream. And, uh, your sister? The one who taught you how to be funny? Who is she, Humor?" He hoped that Dream understood that he was being earnest and not trying to insult another Endless, one he hadn't even met.

No insult had ocurred, judging by the soft smile that appeared on Dream's lips. "**She'll be amused to hear you said that,**" he murmured, a mental note to himself, then added, to Hob, "**But no. She's Death. It is to her you owe your immortality.**"

And Hob had lost his big boy voice once again. "Give her my thanks, then," he squeaked.

"**I will, Hob Gadling,**" Dream answered with such finality that Hob sensed the end of his visit approaching. Which, by the way, begged the question—

"Hey, uh, bit of a change of subject, but I didn't catch the reason for your visit, my friend," Hob prompted, knowing full well that none have been given.

Just because Hob had every inch of that face memorized (and he liked to think that was a very normal thing for friends to do, thank you very much) was he able to catch the momentary awkwardness in Dream's expression. "**To visit you,**" he explained with a furrowed brow. "**To visit a friend**."

Something that ran warmer than his blood usually did started thrumming through Hob's veins. "A social call, then?"

"**Aye**," was the curt reply.

"Much obliged." Look at them, a couple of old men just spending some time together because they could, _a social call_.

Dream had stood up in that infuriatingly deadly silent manner of his. "**I should take my leave now.**"

Fighting back disappointment (he had gotten the chance to see him a mere _month_ after their last meeting, stop being greedy), Hob smiled. "It was nice to see you, old friend."

"**You too, Hob. I—**" It was still such a bizarre experience to see Dream act hesitant about anything. "**My Kingdom keeps me quite busy, but I'd like to say you again before our next set appointment.**"

"I'd love that." Hob no longer had to force his smile.

With one last nod to signal his goodbye, Dream turned towards the door and walked out. Hob heard an impossible rush of wind within the closed hallway and the telltale sound of moving sand. It was kind of sweet of him, to say goodbye and use doors and walk away, even if he did end up causing up a confusing situation for the cleaning staff to deal with later.
