# Let me be your knight

## Chapter 1

Hob had written a speech. At one point, he had sat down and he had written an honest-to-God speech. He had already bought himself one of those new IBM personal computers, but he hadn't developed the habit of using it, so pen and paper it was. He had grabbed pen and paper and had written down everything he was going to tell His Stranger when—no, _if_—no, _when_ he decided to show his face again.

He had started his speech with an apology about the lack of tact from his part. He had meant what he had said, sure, but he could've said it better. Then he had added a quip or two about how rude it was to leave _an acquaintance_ hanging without even a note to say he'd miss their meeting. He had a mobile phone now, too, if he wanted to call. And a pager. Then those "quips" had evolved into ranting about how he's _oh so sorry_ that his pride had been wounded, but that's no excuse to be an absolute piece of shit with no regard for the feelings of others, and if he thought he could just waltz back into Hob's life like nothing had happened, he had another thing coming. Then that already barely coherent rant had evolved into a string of curses and smudged ink. Hob had been very drunk at the time.

God knows where that written speech was now, and at one point he had even decided that, when the moment came, he wouldn't say a single damn thing. Let the bastard do all the talking, if Hob even deigned to acknowledge his presence.

The moment came. Tugged by the strings of Fate, Hob lifted his gaze up from the papers he was grading and there he was, his choice of goth outfit for this century consisting of a long black coat over a black shirt and black skinny jeans. His hair was a fucking mess, and there was something about the look on his face. Serious, sure, but not stern and pinched like it had been during previous meetings. There wasn't a shadow of proud arrogance that expected Hob to fall to his knees and beg for forgiveness for his imprudence. In fact, he looked hesitant.

All of Hob's resolve vanished in an instant. He smiled, he couldn't help himself. He could be headstrong in many other moments of his life; he could allow himself to have one weakness, one tall, pale, angular Achilles heel. "You're late."

Dear stars above, was that a smile he got in response? And the quietest of chuckles? "**It seems I owe you an apology. I've always heard it impolite to keep one's friends waiting.**"

And that was it for Robert Gadling. A meteorite could fall right outside the New Inn and he wouldn't even notice. He felt a new smile, wider and brighter, spread across his face as his friend, his _friend_, sat down across from him. And he did so in a way that was so uncharacteristically relaxed that Hob couldn't help but relax, too, easing back into the seat, fingers toying with his glass of beer.

(There was a small part of him that kept prodding, that growled lowly like a caged beast. That was it? An apology, sure, but no explanation? 33 years of heartbreak and alcohol, and no explanation? 133 years, if he counted the ones he'd been in denial. He did his best to ignore that part of himself.)

"Do you, uh..." Hob cleared his throat. "Do you want anything to drink?"

His Stranger still had a smile on his lips, somehow, impossibly. "**Just wine, thank you. Red.**" Now this dance he knew. He'd have a wineglass in front of him, almost as if he wanted to complete the human ritual of "being in a pub", but he'd never touch it. Hob could deal with such a familiar thing. He flagged down the waitress (Wendy, sociology student, 3<sup>rd</sup> year) and placed the order for his friend (_his friend_!). Why he made sure to order a good one when it would go untouched, he didn't know.

Then there was silence, and even with the beast inside of Hob, it felt comfortable. He knew he was going to be the one to break it. He'd start prattling about the past century (plus some years, 33, who was counting), and his friend would remain silent, listening to whatever bullshit Hob had to say. That was what he knew, what was familiar, but today was apparently opposite day, or "Fuck with Hob's perception of reality" day, because his friend spoke first.

"**Dream.**" A pause, long enough for Hob to wonder what the fuck was going on. "**Or Morpheus. Oneiros. Kai'ckul. Sandman. Take your pick.**"

"My... my pick?" There was something deep, deep, deep, deep, _deep_ inside of Hob whispering that he knew exactly what was happening, but he chose to ignore it because he didn't believe it. Whatever was happening was not what Hob thought (_hoped_) was happening. "O-Of what, exactly?"

The smile was a smirk now; the bastard was doing it on purpose. "**My name,**" he said simply, like he didn't know he was dumping a bucket of cold water on Hob's head. "**I could offer more.**"

Oh. So what was happening was what Hob had thought was happening. Okay. _This_ was happening. He was getting a name. Name<em>s</em>, plural. And he could take his pick, if he wanted to. He didn't want to. That wasn't his choice to make. He took a swig of beer for courage. "Which one do you want me to use?"

There was a millisecond of surprise in the other's expression. He quickly schooled it, though, and replied, "**Dream.**"

"Dream."

"**Dream of the Endless.**"

"Dream _of the Endless_? Tad dramatic, don't you think?"

"**I _am_ endless.**"

And what the _fuck_ do you answer to that. If you're Hob Gadling, you down the rest of your beer and mutter, "Aren't we all, brother." That got him a laugh. And it was wonderful.

"**Such insolence, thinking that just by being immortal you can call yourself one of us,**" Dream said, and his tone was playful. It was clear that he was joking, and yet... **_one such as I_**... The wording wasn't even that similar. Hob would've brushed it off as his nerves getting the better of him, if it wasn't for the way Dream immediately pressed his lips into a tight line and looked away. So. He'd heard it, too.

Wendy, bless her heart, chose that moment to set down Dream's drink. It should've been a tiny break in the tension, gone before Hob could take advantage of it to change the topic. That's what it should've been. By now, it was settled that today was not the day for "should've"s or "known"s or "familiar"s.

Dream took a sip.

He took the wineglass by the stem with fingers that looked even more fragile than the stem itself, swirled its contents around, sniffed it, and took a small sip.

What. The _ever-loving_ fuck was going on.

Dream was looking down at the crimson wine, watching it lap at the sides of the glass. When he spoke, Hob was sure he was speaking to himself, not even realizing he was speaking out loud. "**It's always the little things you miss.**"

And here comes Hob Gadling, Britain's undefeated champion at the art of putting his fucking foot in his mouth. "Am I a little thing?" The cheeky comment slipped out unchecked. Fuck. Here's to another 133 years of regret.

Dream's hand froze so abruptly that the wine sloshed and threatened to spill out of the glass. When he lifted his gaze to meet Hob's, there was steely determination in them. Not anger, not wounded pride, but it still made Hob's stomach knot with anxiety. His voice sounded even deeper when he said, "**I wouldn't call you that, my friend, but I did miss you. Missed our meeting.**"

Hob felt his only beer of the night surge back up from his stomach up his throat, around his brain, behind his eyes, and all the way down to his feet. He was on cloud nine. He was heartbroken. He had forgiven Dream the moment he walked into the New Inn. He was angry. He was confused. The word "miss" all of a sudden had too many meanings. _Of course you missed our meeting, you stupid bastard, you_ weren't there. _But did you also ache at the lack of it, from wherever you were, nursing your wounded pride and letting me stew in my pain for an extra 33 years?_ Hob closed his eyes (a feeble attempt at keeping his tears in check) before managing to push out two words. "Then why...?"

"**I know I owe you an explanation.**"

And then there was silence. Not a pause, not a buildup towards an explanation. Silence. Of course. Hob rubbed his eyes and let out a pitiful excuse for a laugh. So much for a straightforward answer. Like herding fucking cats...

"**I was captured and imprisoned.**"

Hob's eyes flew open. It was like a switch was flipped inside him. All of his pain, his self-pity, his anger at Dream, all of it flocked together into a single razor-sharp blade of anger pointed at a new nameless enemy. "Who?" he growled.

"**Hob...**"

"_Who?"_

"**They've all been dealt with.**"

"Good." Hob would never call himself a good man, and not wishing ill upon others was a rule of good men. He wished that whatever way they had been dealt with had been tenfold whatever suffering they'd put Dream through.

Dream's gaze was stern again when he reiterated his previous statement. "**It really did pain me to miss our last meeting, specially considering the way we parted in our meeting before that.**"

Another sad little laugh. "Yeah, I think that 30-plus years of imprisonment absolves you from that, dear heart." He'd never called him that before. Why was he calling him that? Why was he so keen in testing the limits today until he screwed everything up again? What would Dream-

"**A century. I was there for a century.**"

Hob thought he was going to fall off his chair with the wave of nausea that hit him. "Bloody _hell_, Dream." He steadied himself. "Are you okay?" Dream's eyes were suddenly elsewhere. Of course he wasn't okay. What a stupid question. To make up for it, Hob stepped up his game with a stupid action: he reached across the table and squeezed Dream's hand. "I'm here for whatever you need," he said softly.

The universe stopped dead in its tracks. Dream looked down at where Hob's hand was still on his own. Hob had the very foreign feeling that he was about to die.

Dream placed his other hand on top of Hob's. "**Thank you, my friend.**"

Hob had the very foreign feeling that he was being born again into a whole new world.

## Chapter 2

The moment ended a handful of seconds after it started, but it was enough for Hob to commit to memory how every inch of his skin that was in contact with Dream's felt. It hadn't been a brusque separation, either. Dream simply eased back into his chair, taking his hands with him. Pity. Hob didn't move his hand for a while, just in case.

"—and yeah, it's slowly becoming a state of constant surveillance, your vacuum cleaner contains a detailed floor plan of your home, it's all gonna come back to bite us in the arse sooner rather than later, but hey! We said the same thing about electrical lights, didn't we? Well, yeah, it might be worse this time around, but look at this! Once upon a time, you felt any sort of physical ailment and they'd stick a leech on you and call it a day. Now, a fucken shiny square is telling me to go for a walk before the day ends to reach my daily step goal!" A sweeping gesture at his watch. "I swear, this thing is going to have an artificial existencial crisis when the years pass and my heartbeat never stops. That is, if the damned things were built to last. I've had breeches that lasted longer than one of my new phones."

He had been rambling about the past century for quite some time now. It was dark outside (yeah, his watch was going to be angry at him about the step goal, but Dream took priority. Over everything.). He had three empty beer glasses in front of him, and in front of Dream was an empty wineglass. Hob hadn't even suggested he get a second; he didn't want to push the amount of miracles that could happen in one day.

He placed both hands on the table, leaned back, and caught his breath. He wasn't sure when he had adopted those series of gestures to end a rant, but he knew that his students recognized them as the signal to hit "Stop" on their phone's stopwatch. The little bastards timed him. He knew there was a spreadsheet somewhere with a detailed account of his personal records. Cheeky fuckers. He loved them so much. "So..." He had no idea what he wanted to say next. If this were one of their previous meetings, that would be it, after his recount of the century. Well. No. There was one more thing missing, if they were going to dance their usual dance. "Aren't you going to ask me?"

Dream furrowed his brow minutely as he processed the question, but when he understood, his little smirk was very similar to the one from right after the Constantine incident. Oh, how Hob loved that smirk. "**Hadn't we agreed that it was pointless for me to ask by now?**"

"Come on! For the sake of tradition, my friend!"

Dream's sigh carried frustration and affection in equal quantities. And a whole lot of theatrics. "**Fine.**" He eyed Hob like one eyes an annoying little pet who demands treats. "**Robert Gadling. Do you still wish to live?**"

Hob knew the question was coming. He had asked for it, for fuck's sake. He knew his answer; it had not changed in six hundred years. A three-letter word would suffice. But _no_. His reaction was a pair of fingerguns and "You know it, baby."

Why? Why the _fuck_ did he do that? Why the fuck did he _say_ that?

Dream was staring at him with a blank expression. Time to holster those guns, partner. "That..." Hob cleared his throat. "That means yes."

And Dream laughed. A huff of sound escaped his lips, and he placed a loose fist over it to hide it, but his eyes shone with mirth. "**You are insufferable,**" he said, and Hob felt himself drown in the affection those words carried.

Hob was tugging at his earlobe again, damned little tick. "Eh, you only have to deal with me once a century."

Dream glanced down at his empty wineglass, traced its edge with a pale finger once, twice, thrice, and raised his eyes to Hob again. "**Friends meet more often than centennially, yes?**"

Hob's throat felt dry. A fourth beer was sounding quite enticing all of a sudden. Tread very carefully, Gadling. "Friends do, yes," he stammered.

Dream nodded slowly. "**Then I shall do my best to come visit you soon, dear friend.**" He stood up, and then this man, god, _being_ awarded Hob one last miracle: "**Shall I walk you home?**" Dream's lips twisted into a playful little smile. "**To appease your _square_?**"

Well, that sounded just lovely, except— "I live upstairs, mate," Hob replied with a sheepish grin, and Dream looked positively shocked, his mouth a perfect "o". "Yeah, it was the easiest solution, I already owned the land, couldn't be arsed to deal with even more real estate."

"**You own... this land?**"

Hob was able to divert his hand before it tugged at his earlobe yet again, running it through his hair instead. "Yup. Spotted it, bought it, had the New Inn built on top of it," he said. _For you,_ he didn't say.

_For me,_ Dream's shocked faced seemed to say. "**I-**"

Hob couldn't bear to hear whatever was going to come after in that sentence. "You can walk me to the stairs," he cut in, pointing to the door next to the bar.

This day had been so bizarre that when Dream's shocked expression morphed into a smile, normalcy was restored into the world. "**Lead the way**," he said with a tilt of the head that was almost a bow, if one such as Dream of the Endless would ever bow to one such as Hob Gadling.

## Chapter 3

When Dream had said he'd try to visit him sooner than 2089, Hob expected to see him in 50 years, turning their meetings into a semicentennial occurrence and patting himself in the back for doing such a good job at playing the part of normal friend. Instead, Dream showed up at his office a little more than a month later.

Hob, as seemed to be his custom, started talking before he was done thinking. "How did you know where— right, Endless, whatever, don't answer that, not that you were going to answer anyway."

Dream's rigid stance and expression were solemn as ever, but there was a hint of taunting in his voice when he said, "**"Hello, Dream. How are you, Dream? How have you been keeping, Dream?"**"

Hob pointed at him with a plastic fork that still held the cherry tomato he had been about to indulge in when he had sensed a pair of eyes (_that_ pair of eyes) watching him from the open doorway. "I don't know who taught you how to be funny, but I'd like to have a word with them. I don't think they realize the horrors they've unleashed into the world." He popped the tomato into his mouth before gesturing at the empty chair across his desk. "Close the door behind you, will you? This is technically my lunch break, but I like to keep an "all hours are office hours if you see my door open" policy for the kids, in case they need something."

After doing as he was asked, Dream slid into the offered chair. Once again, his posture was so at ease that Hob felt a sparkle of pride knowing his friend felt like he could relax around him. "**That honor would go to my older sister, I am afraid,**" he retorted to Hob's banter, "**if you want to take your complaints up to her.**"

Hob could've choked on the piece of lettuce he had just put in his mouth. He could've sputtered, freaked out, demanded more information, but he decided that no, he wasn't doing that today. "Right. You have a sister. Of course. Endless, too, I presume. Obviously. No doubt about it. Still no bleeding clue what any of that means, but live and let live, right?"

Dream tilted his head in a way that Hob would've called adorable if he were looking to get his tongue ripped out of his skull by a god. "**Has the ever-curious Hob Gadling run out of questions?**"

"The ever-patient Hob Gadling is done asking questions he won't receive an answer to, as a little bit of self-care, to adopt the sayings of the century."

"**I cannot wait to see how long _that_ lasts.**"

"Eat shit, mate." Dream's eyebrow climbed up a good inch, and Hob feared that he had gotten a bit too comfortable in their new comradery, but Dream didn't storm out. Look positively pissy, he did, but he stayed put, so Hob guessed he was in the clear. "Apologies. Eat shit, milord."

Dream pursed his lips. "**I wonder if knowledge about who I am would make you choose your words more carefully, but I fear that that is a lost cause.**"

As he put his now empty salad container back into his bag, Hob let out a dramatic sigh. "You could try, but I must warn you: I've already drawn up a pretty good picture of who you are with the names you gave me last time, and I'm still not very careful with what I say."

Dream's pissy mood uncoiled just a smidge. "**You've become quite a scholar, haven't you?**"

While the (almost) compliment was pleasant to receive, Hob felt it was his duty as liaison for humanity before Dream of the Endless to clarify a thing or two. "Mate," he began slowly, "I just needed to know how to google shit." He pulled his laptop closer from where he had pushed it aside to eat, opened a new browser tab and typed in "morpheus". He turned the laptop around so the screen was facing Dream. "There. From putting it all together, I figured you are some sort of god of sleep."

Without paying any attention to the screen (huh, Hob would've thought that in his vanity he'd love to read about himself), Dream let out a shallow laugh, "**A _god_.**" He sounded extremely amused, as if his good friend Hob were taking the piss by calling him such a lowly name. "**You think me so fleeting, Robert?**"

Well. Shit. Hob thought he had had a good guess there. Fuck him, apparently, for considering that his immortal, proud, powerful friend was something as meager as a _god_. "You said you were Endless," he answered stupidly.

"**And gods are not.**" Obviously. Gods? Endless? Ha! Laughable idea. "**And immortal human men...**" He let his words hang between them, a smirk on his lips.

Hob slammed his laptop shut, but any anger the action could convey was evaporated by his wide grin. "Fine, fine, I get it, we are all but shit beneath your Endless Doc Martens." Another tilt of the head. "Your boots." Damn him to Hell but he had been right, Hob couldn't help but be his usual curious self. "I yield. What, exactly, does it mean to be Endless?"

Dream, damn him to Hell and back, gave himself a moment to bask in his victory, and then he rearranged his long legs so that the ankle of one was resting on the knee of the other. "**You catch me in a good mood, my friend,**" he basically purred, and the contented sound combined with the knowledge that, despite everything, his friend could still have good moods made the corners of Hob's lips twitch. "**We of the Endless, for there are seven of us, predate your kind, your gods, and your world. I am the Lord of the Dreaming, Creator of Dreams, King of Nightmares, Shaper of Forms. I contain the entirety of the human unconsciousness. Whensoever you sleep, you enter the Dreaming. The Dreaming is me, and I am the Dreaming.**"

Hob was glad for his previous research because, as it was, he felt like his brain was melting into goo, even when he had already coached himself mentally to accept that his Stranger turned friend was a god. And then it turns out that "god" fell short of the mark, and that little speech...

"Christ's fingernails..." Now there's a phrase he hadn't used in a while. "So, uh-" Hob paused and swallowed, trying to find his voice, his real voice, not that pitchy excuse for a sound. "So you are Dream. And, uh, your sister? The one who taught you how to be funny? Who is she, Humor?" He hoped that Dream understood that he was being earnest and not trying to insult another Endless, one he hadn't even met.

No insult had ocurred, judging by the soft smile that appeared on Dream's lips. "**She'll be amused to hear you said that,**" he murmured, a mental note to himself, then added, to Hob, "**But no. She's Death. It is to her you owe your immortality.**"

And Hob had lost his big boy voice once again. "Give her my thanks, then," he squeaked.

"**I will, Hob Gadling,**" Dream answered with such finality that Hob sensed the end of his visit approaching. Which, by the way, begged the question—

"Hey, uh, bit of a change of subject, but I didn't catch the reason for your visit, my friend," Hob prompted, knowing full well that none have been given.

Just because Hob had every inch of that face memorized (and he liked to think that was a very normal thing for friends to do, thank you very much) was he able to catch the momentary awkwardness in Dream's expression. "**To visit you,**" he explained with a furrowed brow. "**To visit a friend**."

Something that ran warmer than his blood usually did started thrumming through Hob's veins. "A social call, then?"

"**Aye**," was the curt reply.

"Much obliged." Look at them, a couple of old men just spending some time together because they could, _a social call_.

Dream had stood up in that infuriatingly deadly silent manner of his. "**I should take my leave now.**"

Fighting back disappointment (he had gotten the chance to see him a mere _month_ after their last meeting, stop being greedy), Hob smiled. "It was nice to see you, old friend."

"**You too, Hob. I—**" It was still such a bizarre experience to see Dream act hesitant about anything. "**My Kingdom keeps me quite busy, but I'd like to see you again before our next set appointment.**"

"I'd love that." Hob no longer had to force his smile.

With one last nod to signal his goodbye, Dream turned towards the door and walked out. Hob heard an impossible rush of wind within the closed hallway and the telltale sound of shifting sands. It was kind of sweet of him, to say goodbye and use doors and walk away, even if he did end up causing a confusing situation for the cleaning staff to deal with later.

## Chapter 4

The next time Dream visited him, Hob feared for his immortal life.

First of all, the bastard didn't knock. Second of all, if materializing in a flurry of sand in the middle of his living room wasn't enough to scare the bejeezus out of Hob, the look of pure rage in his eyes finished the job quite nicely. Third of all, the pacing. He stepped out of his cloud of sand and began pacing, back and forth, saying nothing. Once his heart remembered that it wasn't allowed to kill Hob and began to beat again, his brain rebooted and his thoughts raced. Had he done something to piss Dream off so spectacularly? Said something? _Dreamt_ something? Shit, what had his subconscious come up with that—

"**My friend, I seek your council,**" Dream announced suddenly, halting in his pacing. Oh, wow. That was... new. Very new. And frankly, quite terrifying. Hob felt ridiculous, wearing sweatpants and an old T-shirt, holding a flowered dishrag and a chipped mug, and receiving a visit from Dream of the Endless, who **_seeked his council_**.

Dream was staring at him. Hob realized that seconds, maybe even minutes, had passed and he hadn't said anything yet. "Right. Uh, hi. Hello. Hi." Shaking his head, he slapped the dishrag over his shoulder and pointed at one of the stools on the other side of the counter that divided the living room from the kitchen. The action was so bartender-esque (he had tried it during the New Inn's first year) that what he said next was, "What can I getcha?" He ran a hand over his face. "Uh, no, sorry. I mean, what's troubling you, love? And yeah, sure, what can I get you? I don't have anything too strong up here, but I can always run downstairs if it'll help." Two sentences too late, he realized what had slipped out. God above, it was so fucking early, his mental faculties where probably still somewhere in Dream's realm, he could not be blamed for the shit he said.

Thankfully, Dream was too busy staring daggers at the floor to register anything that had been said, including the endearment. He did not take a seat. "**Can one forgive the man, but not the action?**" His voice was barely above a whisper, and shaking with unchecked rage. "**Even if it's necessary to free oneself from the burden of resentment?**"

Alright, no context, then. No matter, Hob could work with that. "Holding grudges is a horrid mistress, mate, specially when you live as long as we do. I don't—" He tapped the counter a couple of times, searching for the right words. "I don't know who he is or what he did or how you can separate man from action, but... it sounds like you do. And it sounds like you've also realized that he is not worth the trouble of your bitterness."

"**It is not my choice to make. It is not my forgiveness to dole out, either.**" He lifted his gaze to meet Hob's, and Hob felt his stomach climb up to his throat. The anger in those pupil-less, pitch-black pools was not meant for mortal eyes. "**She has already forgiven him, and I have ceased my punishment as I promised. I just wish to understand _how_ she could forgive him after what he did to her.**"

"And you came to me." Hob wasn't sure what he meant by that. On the one hand, yeah, why the fuck had Dream come to him? He had no clue what he was talking about and, considering his friend's metaphysical essence, probably wouldn't even understand if it were explained to him. On the other hand, _he had come to him_. He had needed a friend in his anger and frustration, and he had come to _Hob_. Oh, this was the type of thing that made a guy's heart dance a little jig.

Dream's eyes now had pupils, blue irises, and a very pained look. "**I apologize, I should not have burdened you with issues that do not concern you.**"

"Hey, hey, hey," Hob spoke like he was soothing a spooked cat, and he was walking out of the kitchen and around the counter, and he was taking Dream's hands in his, and Dream was not pulling away, and Jesus Christ, what was he doing? Helping a friend, right. That was it. "I am honored that you came to me for advice, Your Endlessness." He earned a minuscule twitch of the corner of Dream's lips for that, which he called progress. "And I wish I had more advice to offer, but I have never been a wise man. And your friend..." That was a fair assumption, right? One that would not earn him a sharp end to this conversation? "She sounds very wise. Maybe you should listen to her more often."

"**She is, and I should,**" Dream murmured. His eyes were burning holes in Hob's retinas, but it was still a disappointment when they fell to the floor once again. "**I never offered my condolences for your family.**"

Talk about coming out of left field, as the Americans say. Hob let go of Dream's hands in surprise, the heavy weight of old grief pressing down on his chest. It never left, not truly, it just became a part of him, another organ behind his ribs. It not always had weight, but when it did, it was enough to knock the wind out of his lungs. He felt tears stinging at his eyes.

Dream had not moved an inch, hands still poised where Hob had left them, like he hadn't even noticed the reaction his words had caused. In fact, he continued in the exact same murmur, "**Does it help to grieve them?**" Before Hob could comprehend what was being asked, Dream was pinning him down with those eyes again, but this time there wasn't just a glint of unshed tears hanging from the edge, but two wet streaks down Dream's cheeks. "**If I allowed myself to grieve my son, would the pain stop?**"

Hob's already pained heart shattered into a thousand pieces. "Dear heart, look at me," he said, and gestured with a trembling hand to his tear-filled eyes and his chest, because maybe Dream of the Endless could see through flesh and muscle and bone and find knots of grief. "No, it would not stop. But it does help. It helps make the grief a part of you, because it's not going anywhere, but you can at least stop its weight from pulling you under every second of every day. The pain means they mattered. All of them. Eleanor, Robyn, the baby..." He let his words hang because there were many names of lovers and friends that could continue that list, but now was not the time to do that, not when his friend needed him.

"**Orpheus,**" Dream whispered, and Hob realized he was adding a name of his own to the list. He still hadn't moved his hands, and Hob could fool himself and interpret that as waiting for Hob to take them once more. He could do that, but there was something else he wanted to try before.

When Hob brushed away his tears with the pad of his thumb, Dream let his eyes flutter closed, all beautiful, long eyelashes and flawless eyeliner. How could he always look so fragile? He wasn't, of course, but Hob felt like he could shatter under the lightest of touches, but he wouldn't, obviously, he was Endless, he could shatter _Hob_ with a _thought_, there was nothing a mere human could do that would even begin to hurt him, but if there was anything out there that could do any harm to Dream, Hob would track it down and tear it limb for limb, if it had limbs, and if it didn't, there were other things Hob could do.

"**She was right about this, too.**" The deep rumble of Dream's voice drew Hob out of his thoughts. "**About needing to grieve him properly. And I guess that means that you were right, too. My wife _is_ very wise.**"

If one were to write a list of things one does not want to find out about a friend while gently caressing said friend's cheek, the fact that there is a Mrs. Dream of the Endless would be pretty high on it. Hob froze. Shit fucking damn it to Hell, what was he doing? Six hundred years he had survived by only gazing upon this glorious creature, and then in the span of months under this new routine of more frequent visits, he had decided he could get his hands all over him and call him sweet little names. _Love_. _Dear heart_. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Hob stumbled backwards, his now free hand clinging to the dishrag on his shoulder like a lifeline. A _dishrag_ on his shoulder, and he thought himself worthy of touching Dream of the Endless. Stupid, stupid, stupid. "She does, uh," he stammered, "she does sound that way, yes. I, uh..."

"**Hob...**" Dream was staring at him again with his big, wet eyes that always seemed to contain so much emotion, much more than the rest of his body every conveyed. He reached one hand forwards, and Hob took another stumbled step back. "**Hob, we parted ways thousands of years ago. She was my wife once, and I still sometimes refer to her as such, but by all meanings, we are no longer husband and wife.**"

And the fact that Dream felt the need to clarify _that_ was giving Hob ludicrous ideas about Dream's intentions. And even if he wasn't misunderstanding him, even if he really... No, how could Hob act on it now? What kind of dickwad receives a friend in need, a friend suffering from something that had happened to his (ex)wife and from the loss of a son, and thinks, "Yeah, sure, this is the perfect time to make a move"? Before he could do something stupid, he stepped aside to provide Dream a clear path to the door, seeing how he was so fond of using them despite there being no need. "I hope I've been of assistance, my friend." Before, he would've killed to have his Stranger visit him for more than a couple of hours once a century. Now, he was cutting one such visit short.

He had forgotten one little detail, and that is that no one denied the King of Dreams anything, not even one's hand when he reaches his forward. Closing the distance between them, he placed the hand he had offered before over Hob's, damp dishrag be damned. "**Just by existing you have provided me more assistance over the centuries than you could ever imagine. I need you to know that. I've treated you unfairly in the past because of my foolish pride, but I don't want to do that anymore, even—**" He tightened his jaw slightly, something in his eyes revealing that the battle against his pride was not over yet. "**Even if it scares me. Hob...**" His other hand joined the first. "**Hob, if you return my affection—**"

**_Return my affection_**, how could he be so damn cute when he talked all solemn with his deep voice and fancy words. "Darling, you are hurting—"

"**And you always know how to make me feel better.**"

"—and I'm very glad that is the case, but," God, was he really about to say this? "can we put a pin in this?" Not being a saint of unbreakable convictions, he raised Dream's hands to his lips and brushed a kiss across the knuckles. "Save this conversation for peaceful times?"

"**Peaceful times**." Dream said the words like their meaning was foreign. "**Even if those are far into the future?**"

Hob offered him a small smile. Grief sometimes made you feel that way, but peace had the stubborn habit of returning; Hob had seen it do so many times. "Hey, I'm a patient man, but either way, they can't possibly be that far away."

Dream sighed with exasperation, as if Hob was being particularly thick. "**They very well can be, when one's kingdom is at war with the forces of Hell.**"

## Chapter 5

Hob had read somewhere that we are never just our current age. Every year we live piles on upon the ones before it, adding our experiences in such a way that we can never just be _this_ age. We are everyone we've ever been, all at once. As someone with so many years to add up, Hob enthusiastically agreed. The good and the bad, all 667 years, all of it was Hob Gadling, with all of those moving parts surfacing and falling into obscurity across time.

For example, right now, he was once again a medieval peasant, wishing he had his mother's bone rosary to cling to as a pretty massive crisis of faith crashed over him. Sure, he had abandoned all semblances of religion around, oh, 1524? but there are certain names you never forget to fear, even when you stop believing in the existence of the entity they belong to. And then your friendly neighborhood anthropomorphic personification of dreams flips that over on its head.

"So... Lucifer Morningstar is not only very real... but he holds a personal grudge against you and is invading your kingdom because of it."

They had moved to the couch at some point. There was a big mush of colors and sounds were Hob's memories of that process should be, but the point is that that's where they were now. Hob had his face in his hands, and through the gaps between his fingers he could see Dream sitting very stiffly a respectful distance away. The Lord of Dreams and Nightmares, telling him about Satan, all while sitting in his shitty little IKEA couch.

"**_They_ hold a personal grudge against me,**" Dream corrected instead of saying, for example, "I'm fucking with you, mate, of course they're not real."

Hob rubbed his face for the umpteenth time in the past half hour. "Sure. What _can't_ queer people do these days? Go us." The look Dream shot him managed to be both confused and annoyed. Feeling some life return to his legs, Hob decided to stand up and walked over to the kitchen. Reaching under the counter, he pulled out one of the few bottles of liquor he kept upstairs and two crystal tumblers. As he stared at the amber liquid, he realized that, no, this would not be enough, but he had promised himself— Wait.

"You don't have lungs, do you?" Dream's expression was definitely just confused now. Yeah, he probably didn't.

Hob opened one of the cabinets over his small stove, moving aside some of the spice jars so he could reach behind them and all the way back, feeling around until— Et voilà. It was a bit of a challenge to get the lighter to work with shaking fingers, and a second challenge to hold the flame steady, but soon enough he was blowing all of his problems away in a little gray cloud, head tilted back, cigarette held elegantly between index and middle finger. Like riding a bike.

"**That is absolutely disgusting.**"

"Shut up, I'm coping."

"**The man who sang praises for the chimney, now willingly bringing smoke into his home.**"

"Dream, love, I really need you to shut up for a second."

"**You know those things—**"

"Will kill me? Is that what you were going to say?" After another long drag, Hob leaned forwards on the counter to stare at Dream. "I started when it was in fashion. I stopped when I learnt about secondhand smoking. You don't have lungs. _Please_ let me have this before I break down crying over the existence of Hell."

"**I _do_ have a sense of smell,**" Dream grumbled, but otherwise dropped the matter entirely.

There was a blissful silence in the flat after that. The only sounds were Hob's inhales, pulling in, in, in, deep into the lungs, filling them with the stuff, hold, hold, hold, out in a long exhale, smoke curling out his nose and mouth. Could he still do smoke rings? He gave it a try with the next exhale. Crooked, unstable O. He'd have to try again. His next exhale came with a word: "Whoooo..." A bit less crooked, a bit less unstable. "Are..." He had forgotten to properly administer his smoke, so all that was left for this second word was a sad little puff. Laughter overtook him, quickly replaced by a cough. "Y-You," he finished amidst his coughing. Once all the smoke was out of his lungs and he had taken a good, clean deep breath, the cough subsided. "Bloody magical caterpillar," he chuckled under his breath.

"**I am starting to worry about your mind's stability.**"

Right. Dream. Hob had had his selfish little respite, but it was time to get back to the matter at hand. "M'alright, nothing to worry about, just getting my wits all sorted out again with a bit of fun." He grabbed both tumblers from the counter, shifting around the one in his right hand so it didn't catch any ash from his cigarette. "Doing a bit from _Alice_, dove, don't worry, I know who _you_ are, at least now I do." His ramblings were probably not helping paint a picture of perfect mental stability. Eh. He'd run out of steam eventually. He placed one tumbler (left hand, certifiably ash-free) on the coffee table in front of Dream, who watched him with a wrinkled nose, either from the offer of liquor, the proximity of the cigarette, or both. A very lordly look, very... 1589? Before he ran off? Hob eased back into his end of the couch. "Sorry, I needed a minute there. Right. Back to where we were. Hell. War. Right. How can I help?"

Dream's dignified disgust disappeared when he frowned. "**Help?**"

"Yeah, how can I help? I'm guessing this invasion is taking place in a different part of the Dreaming from the one I visit every night 'cause I haven't noticed anything amiss. I'm going to need a couple of pointers to get to the battlefield, my liege."

With a voice that had shifted down a couple of octaves in a very inhuman way, Dream enunciated coldly, "**You. Are _not_. Fighting.**"

Well, then. The King had spoken. Nothing to do about it. Unless you're Hob Gadling. "Yeah, I fucking am. I have the experience, I'm in, uh, decent shape, and most importantly: I can be there for you for this. I wasn't there—" No, he still couldn't say it. "I wasn't there last time; let me be there this time. I _need_ to be there this time."

Dream stood up abruptly, all white-hot fury and **_then I shall take my leave of you and prove you wrong_**. Hob swallowed, but did not break eye contact. "**I will _not_ have you fight in a war that does not concern you. Not for me. Not for anyone.**"

"First of all, that's how wars work, that's their whole point, putting some guy that barely knows what's going on in the front. Trust me, I've been that guy quite a few times." Hob finished what remained of his drink, dropped the cigarette into the tumbler, and stood up to be eye to eye with Dream. "Second of all, this one is the exception. It very much does concern me because it concerns _you_. I know there's still that conversation we haven't had, but I..." He sighed, unsure of how to word the turmoil inside of him.

"**If you say you'd die for me, I'll know your words to be hollow, Hob Gadling.**"

Hob smiled, not in a way that reached his eyes but in a way that had charmed lovers, law enforcers, commanding officers, and barkeeps across the centuries. "I'd kill for you. How's that, huh?" He sealed the deal with a wink.

Dream was not swayed. "**This war is beyond your comprehension, even with your "experience".**"

On the one hand, understatement of the millennia, Hob could barely begin to wrap his head around the idea of the Dreaming, and he couldn't picture the enemy beyond caricatures and pictures drawn in chapel walls to force him to remain pious. On the other, the Hob that fought in Burgundy would have a fit equal to one from learning about the existence of Lucifer if he learnt about tanks, let alone the atom bomb. And then he'd down his ale and run into the battlefield. He's stupid like that. "I'm an adaptable man, you know that about me."

Dream held his gaze, but said nothing for a beat. He was running out of arguments, but he was also as stubborn as Hob. Unstoppable force meets immovable object, alright. Finally, with a softer tone, he said, "**There is a way you can help me.**"

Hob's eyebrows shot up. "Oh?"

"**Be here. Let me come back to you after the war. Let me look forward to seeing you again, and let that be what keeps my strength up, just like it has for the past six hundred years.**"

Hob still had some words left to say to _that_, but it's rather hard to argue with a swirl of sand slowly settling on your living room floor. His second option after arguing was to make his way through the rest of the pack, but when he turned towards the counter, there was just a small pile of sand next to his lighter. Absolute bastard.

## Chapter 6

This was definitely a perfect evening. He was sitting under a huge oak tree that shielded him from the rays of the setting sun. The apple in his hand was crisp and juicy. He had been playing Animal Crossing for hours with no interruption. Just this morning, a sign had been posted in the town square announcing the definite end of all flea-kind from here to eternity. A young maid walked by with a pail of wine from the nearby spring. At Hob's "How fare ye?", she giggled and blushed. Now, that could prove interesting. He could put his Nintendo down and let her lead the way to the nearest barn.

Huh.

Something was not quite right with that picture. No, that was ridiculous. It was the perfect evening. What could possibly be wrong? Yet something inside him insisted and tugged at his mind. Something was off. Think, Robert, think. What do Nintendos in the fourteenth century and springs that flow with wine have in common?

"Shit, I'm dreaming." Both the Nintendo and the apple immediately vanished. He forced himself to calm down; he couldn't afford to startle himself awake. It had been two weeks and three days since he had last seen Dream. Ever since then, he'd go to bed every night determined to have lucid dreams (he read a lot about it online) so he could look for the bastard in his own turf. He had failed every night, until now.

Hob stood up and looked around. The tranquil British countryside remained stubbornly unchanged. "Hullo, Lord of the Dreaming?" Nothing. "Come on, come _on_. I have to see him." There, in the corner of his eye, a ripple. "_Please_. I need to see him. Let me see him. Take me to your leader or whatever. Please." Everything paused. The wind rustling through leaves, the swaying blades of grass, the sounds from the town just over the hill. There was doubt in that pause, and yeah, Hob could apparently sense doubt felt by a _landscape_. One more time, really drive the message home. "Please, I want to help."

And that was it, the world around him shuddered and rippled. The sky burst at its seams. Where there had only been idle clouds and the last golden rays of the day, nebulas and galaxies now pushed through unseen tears in the firmament to swallow his dream whole, whisking him away to who knows where, where he'd—

"Wait!"

Another pause, hesitant and confused.

With his right hand standing by at the ready, Hob focused on the memory of the weight on his hip until it became a reality, and his hand wrapped around the hilt of his longsword. "Okay, I'm ready. Let's go."

---

When the universe regurgitated him, he was standing within the most impressive room he had ever seen or could've ever imagined. Gothic columns rose high into a vaulted ceiling that wasn't a ceiling at all, but the whirling collection of nebulas and galaxies he'd seen before. Each column carried the bust of some fantastical creature or another. At the end of the room, there were three stained-glass windows depicting... well, it was hard to describe what they were depicting, for they were _alive_, pieces of glass shifting around to form now a bizarre map, now a person with short blonde hair and bat wings, now _another_ blonde person with golden eyes. In front of them rose a twisting staircase that led to a platform that held a single black throne. Ah. A throne room.

All of that was very impressive and whatnot, but Hob's attention was entirely elsewhere. There was a man standing in the middle of the room with his back turned to Hob. He seemed... _different_ here, in his realm, instead of out there in Hob's reality, but Hob would know that hairdresser's nightmare of untamed black hair anywhere. Next to him was an impeccably dressed woman with dark skin, glasses, shaved head, and pointed ears, but maybe that last part was a trick of the light. Or maybe not. He was dreaming, after all. She was staring at Hob with her eyes wide like saucers.

"My Lord," she began hesitantly, and Dream made a noncommittal noise, still not turning around. "There is a, uh, a—"

Anyone who worked for Dream deserved all the help they could get (and probably a raise), so Hob swooped in to her rescue. "A Sir Robert Gadlen, at your service, Your Majesty." He bowed with an exaggerated flourish that would've suited the entitled prick he had been when he wore that title (but hey, legally a knight! That's the kind of shit that really polishes a CV). Dream had somehow managed to stiffen his posture even more, so Hob chuckled nervously, "I'm kidding, it's me. Hob. Just Hob. Gadling, not Gadlen. You know. Hob. Little old me." The woman was shaking her head from side to side very slowly. Hob decided that the best moment to shut his mouth had been like two minutes ago, and the second best was right now.

"**_How_**..." The word was a venomous hiss that made the stained-glass windows rattle. Dream clenched his fists and Hob had the terrifying impression that his entire form undulated like liquid shadow before regaining its solid consistency. He spun around and the light from the night sky above them hit him just right. Hob swallowed. May the Lord have mercy on his immortal soul, Dream was dressed for battle. He was wearing a black robe and a fitted black leather cuirass. Between the outfit and the angered expression, his face looked sharper, gaunter, and it was breathtakingly beautiful. Undisturbed by the lovestruck expression Hob knew himself to be wearing, Dream continued, "**How are you here, Robert Gadling?**"

The woman closed her eyes and pinched her nose, but Hob merely shrugged. "I have no bloody clue, if I'm honest. I just asked nicely to see you and here I am. So to answer your question: with good manners and good looks?"

It was the first time Hob heard him laugh louder than a huff, easily lost in a noisy tavern, but Dream's laugh was as loud as it was lifeless. "**Splendid. I am at war, and now I have to concern myself with the appearance of another vortex as well.**" Hob had no idea what that meant, but there was a flash of pain in Dream's eyes.

"My Lord, if I may..." When the woman spoke, Dream glanced at her as if they both knew that he was going to let her talk and he was not going to like a word of it. This was clearly the way things worked around here because the woman was unfazed. "Sir, there cannot be another vortex so soon after the last, you know this. I don't think this dreamer has the ability to will himself into your throne room. He is not here by a power of his own."

"**Then by whose power is he here, Lucienne?**" Hob was starting to get tired of being talked about like he was an interesting little bug that had flown in.

"I think..." The woman, Lucienne, hesitated. "I think the Dreaming wanted him here." She had to know she wasn't fooling anyone with her choice of words. **_The Dreaming is me, and I am the Dreaming,_** Dream himself had told Hob so.

"**The Dreaming wanted him here,**" Dream repeated. "**Well, what it wants is of no consequence, I will not put him in harm's way, and Hob, by the stars, why on Earth are you raising your hand?**"

"Because I want to talk now, and I've been spending too much time in classrooms lately."

Dream really tried to control the way his scowl almost twitched into a smile then, but Hob was able to catch it. "**Speak, _Professor_ Gadling.**"

"First of all, you jest, but keep calling me that and see where that takes you. Second of all, I've thought a lot about what you said about waiting for you to come home from the war, and I'm sorry, but that's really not my style, I'd rather be by your side throughout it. And third of all, you owe me a pack of cigarettes."

Dream mockingly raised an elegant finger for each of the items Hob had listed as he answered them. First finger: "**I might.**" Second finger: "**You won't be.**" Third finger: "**No, I don't.**"

Hob crossed his arms over his chest. "You keep saying that, but the Dreaming _and_ your counselor think I should fight for you." Lucienne startled, clearly not happy with being dragged into their spat.

"**She's my librarian, not my counselor,**" Dream retorted, narrowing his eyes, "**and if she does think that, then she does not realize that what matters is that you remain out of danger.**"

Okay, they were just going around in circles now. "_You_ want me here, Dream!" Hob exclaimed. "Or else I wouldn't be here! She said so, you know so, and I'm still not sure how this fucking place works, but I know enough to know so, too!"

"**And I already said that what I want is of no consequence!**" Dream's voice boomed in the large throne room, making Hob's teeth shake. "**You will not be put in harm's way just because I had a whim to be protected by some... _peasant-knight_.**" He gestured with a grimace at Hob's cotton tunic and longsword combo, as if the insult would distract him from what he had just admitted.

"There's nothing wrong with wanting to be protected," Hob said gently.

So much emotion danced in Dream's eyes at that moment that it wasn't a surprise when he turned his back on Hob once again. "**Maybe so, but it does not excuse—**"

His words died in his throat when Hob wrapped his arms around his waist. God bless the Dreaming, Hob had only needed to think about taking a step forwards and all of a sudden the space between them was nothing. With his forehead resting against the back of Dream's head, Hob pressed a feather-light kiss to the nape of his neck, delighted at the resulting shiver. "Let me be your knight." He nosed at the short hairs there as Dream melted into his embrace. "Let me protect you from anything that tries to hurt you." He pressed another kiss to the spot behind Dream's ear. "Let me kill anything that lays a finger on you."

Dream's already deep voice had a whole other dimension with Hob's chest pressed against his back. "**I thought you wanted to postpone this conversation.**"

"Oh, that conversation is still happening later, mister. This is all pre-conversation shit. This is just what mates do," Hob snickered. "And don't change the subject."

"**You distracted me.**" Dream turned his head to the side, towards Hob, with lips slightly parted, but Hob took a step back. He wasn't sure if he was doing it because he still had some sort of resolve in him or to be a little shit. If it was the former, he was surprised at his self-control. If it was the latter, he was surprised at his ability to commit to the bit.

"Ah, ah. Careful. Post-conversation territory."

Dream glared pure poison at him over his shoulder before straightening his cuirass, which Hob hadn't even wrinkled. "**Lucienne, can you pass me a sword?**" And it's not that Hob had been so rude as to completely forget she was there, it was more like he had unconsciously assumed she had left the moment he had started nuzzling her boss.

Dream turned to face Hob as Lucienne handed him a pure black masterpiece of a weapon, the engraved hilt depicting a dragon, its tail curling around the knuckle guard, and an onyx stone decorating the pommel. Hob was sure Dream was about to dismiss him in his new favorite way (by vanishing before Hob could get another word in), but Dream was merely staring at him with a cocked head like he was a rather amusing kitten. Before Hob could bark something about Dream taking a picture so it lasted longer, Dream spoke, still very amused, "**I believe tradition dictates you kneel for this.**"

Oh. "Oh!" Hob began lowering himself down to his knees, but stop midway. "Wait, I didn't bathe, well, I did shower, I mean the ritual bath, and the vigil, and I need a moment to remember the words to the oath—"

"**_Hob_.**" Dream raised an eyebrow and gestured with the sword in his hand.

"Fine, fine, damn, someone's in a hurry." Hob knelt and bowed his head. He noticed, amused, that even in his battle regalia, Dream wore his Doc-Martens-style boots.

The sword felt ice cold through his flimsy tunic where it touched his shoulders.

"**Rise, Robert Gadling, knight of the Dreaming.**"

## Chapter 7

As Hob rose with the biggest smile plastered on his face, he noticed that Dream was watching him with a similar, albeit smaller, smile. It was already pretty unorthodox to get re-knighted in the Realm of Dreams, so Hob considered if he should break tradition even further and give his new King a big bear hug. He decided against it. It was unlikely he'd be able to control himself a second time, and there was a war to get to, and necking with the King right after one's knighting ceremony would be quite improper.

"So..." Hob wrung his hands. "What exactly am I fighting? And where? And also... _how_? Do I need some sort of special holy weapon to vanquish the hoards of Hell or...?" Dream pinched his lips into one of his prissy little scowls. "Hey, don't give me that look. I thought I'd just know all of that once I got here. Threshold of revelation, and all that. A blue streak of recognition."

Again with the tilted head and furrowed brow. Did he do it on purpose to be irresistibly cute? "**Threshold of what?**"

"Revelation. From _Angels_? _In America_? Have you read it?"

Dream sighed with annoyance. "**Why does everyone assume I've read or watched things that came out while I was imprisoned?**"

Shit. "Right, sorry," Hob apologized sheepishly. "I'll lend it to you someday, if you want."

There was a gleam of pride in Dream's eyes, like there was something he was just dying to show off about. "**That won't be necessary. My library—**" He stopped, remembering something. He turned towards his librarian who counseled him but who wasn't his counselor (just like Hob had once been the man he spent pleasant evenings in a pub with but who wasn't his friend). "**Lucienne—**"

"The council has assembled and is awaiting your arrival, My Lord," Lucienne answered the unspoken question with just the slightest hint of irritation that told Hob that the council had probably been waiting for a while now for their Lord to stop flirting with the new knight.

Hob hadn't even noticed that Dream had started looking more like he did on their Earthly meetings until his duties came rushing back and once again there was that _something_ that Hob couldn't put his finger on that made him look different. Dream shot Hob one last secret smile before nodding solemnly. "**Then I shall not keep them waiting any longer. Shall we, sir Gadling?**"

"Lead the way, my liege."

---

Firstly: the council was held in the library around one its tables. It all seemed very improvised for Hob for a realm where anything could be created with a thought, but he refrained from making a comment. Secondly: the council apparently consisted simply of Dream, Lucienne, a man with a carved pumpkin for a head (sure), and a beautiful woman with iridescent skin and butterfly wings (of course). There was also a raven standing on the table, but Hob wasn't sure if it was part of the council or not. He didn't want to ask, either, in case he offended His Excellency Sir Raven of the Dreaming Corvids.

Hob had been planning to hang back and silently watch the proceedings. He had never been the type to participate in war rooms. It was somewhat ironic. When he had participated in wars, he had always been yet another foot soldier, cannon fodder. During the time that he had been recognized as a knight, which would've meant a horse and a seat at the table, he was only called so because he had flashed enough gold to the right people, and he had seen no wars during that time. Too busy eating beyond his fill in lamb and hosting the Queen of England. The whole period was a bittersweet memory; he wished he had known Eleanor in better days.

And so he had planned to be but a humble observer, but then Dream had left a space between him and the iridescent woman, and he glanced at Hob for just a millisecond, hesitant. How could he say no to that?

"Oh, wow, a new guy," the raven said. Okay. His Excellency Sir Raven of the Dreaming Corvids, alright. Hob was glad he hadn't asked. "And a _dreamer_, that's interesting."

"**Matthew, this is Hob Gadling, my dear friend and now knight of this realm.**" Hob might've puffed out his chest a bit at that.

"A _friend_?" Matthew squawked, but he was quickly dismissed by the pumpkin-headed man.

"Yeah, yeah, we've all heard of your friend Hob, can we get on with it?"

Hob was starting to get the impression that this council was made up of people (and ravens) who were not likely to grovel and tell Dream only what he wanted to hear, which was, in his opinion, a sign of good leadership from Dream and also a probable source of entertainment for himself. Dream seemed to be seriously doubting both of these things at the moment. "**Mervyn... don't you have duties to attend to elsewhere in the castle?**"

The pumpkin-headed man shrugged (an odd-looking gesture that made Hob wonder if that thing was physically attached to his torso or just sort of placed there). "A war council made up only four beings seemed kinda pathetic, so I decided to drop by to see what I could do. You brought a plus one, maybe I can be Matthew's plus one."

"**Pathe—**" Dream momentarily closed his eyes and gripped the arms of his chair before continuing, "**Thank you for joining us, Mervyn Pumpkinhead, but let me reiterate that Hob is not my "_plus one_": he is a knight of the Dreaming and his insight will be most appreciated.**" That was all very sweet of Dream considering that a while ago Hob had confessed that he hadn't the bloodiest clue how he was supposed to participate in this war.

Hob grinned awkwardly. "Glad to be here." A pause. "What am I going to be fighting?"

"Hell's forces! Demons!" Matthew exclaimed, wildly flapping his wings and ruffling his feathers. "The immortal legions of the abyss! Lucifer Morningstar! Satan! The Devil in knee-high boots!"

"**That's enough, Matthew, thank you,**" Dream interrupted before the raven went into more detail about the Devil's wardrobe. "**The Lightbringer should not be our primary concern. Their entire history is plagued by failure.**" Hob wanted to argue that constantly failing or not, they were still Satan and still sounded like quite a threat, but Dream seemed to be building up to a much more important point. "**Our real concern should be the assistance they are most certainly receiving, or else they would not have been able to enter my realm so easily. An assistance that, I am certain, comes from my sibling.**" The last two words were gritted out through clenched teeth.

"An Endless is helping Satan?" Hob didn't realize he had spoken out loud until every eye (and hole carved in gourd) was on him.

"The ancient laws that bind even the Endless—" Lucienne began.

"**They are helping the Morningstar, I am sure of it,**" Dream snapped. "**They found a way around the laws, somehow.**" There was silence around the table. Matthew shuffled on his talons. Lucienne had pressed her lips tightly together, probably to physically stop herself from arguing back.

"If I may..." The woman's voice was soft, but firm. Out of the corner of his eye, Hob could see patterns swirling on her skin like an oil spill. He didn't dare to turn to look at her fully; he'd probably be mesmerized by the fluctuating colors and stare at her in a way that would be considered rather rude, specially considering... well, Hob was just going to say in his defense that all those years of puritanism and several layers of clothing had left a mark in him that he hadn't fully outgrown.

"**Speak freely, Gault.**"

"Even if Desire of the Endless is behind the scenes of this invasion, we should first focus on Hell's assault. The dreams and nightmares out there are not being torn apart by the question of your sibling's involvement." Gault's voice broke. "They are being torn apart by demons."

Dream's eyes were suddenly rimmed with tears, and Hob shuddered to think of the toll this war was having on his creations. Without thinking (as always), Hob wrapped a hand around Dream's bicep. He was about to draw back (what would the honorable council think of such familiarity between the new knight and their King?) when Dream covered it with his own and squeezed. "**I know. You're right. Thank you, Gault. Hob.**" Hob gave an answering squeeze and lowered his hand. "**I will continue to investigate Desire's involvement but without neglecting our offensive against Hell. I hope that the addition of a very skilled warrior helps turn the tide in our favor.**" He turned to look at Hob with such adoration that Hob feared he was going to be accused of nepotism.

Swallowing down the rising butterflies, Hob replied, "I'll try to live up to your expectations, milord." Could ravens smirk? Because Hob was sure Matthew was smirking at him.

"**It's morning now in your part of the Waking World. Wake, for now, and tonight, I'll see you on the battlefield.**" Hob opened his mouth to argue that he was ready to go _now_, he didn't care if it was morning, let him stay asleep for as long it was necessary, let others think he was a new case of _encephalitis lethargica_, he didn't _care_, but the words vanished from his mind when Dream pushed a strand of hair behind his ear. "**This dream is over.**"

## Chapter 8

It was an interesting time to be Hob Gadling. By day, he was a teacher. By night, he was a knight. Like fucking Batman, if Batman had an actual day job.

His reluctance to be sent back to the Waking World during the day diminished just a teensy bit when he learnt that he wasn't the only one working in shifts. The dreams and nightmares chosen to fight (nightmares of great violence and pain, dreams of protection, safety and healing) were not constantly on duty on the battlefield. On rotations, they were sent out to the rest of the Dreaming, to visit the different dreamers, to do the job they had been created to do and not the one they were forced to do by the horrors invading their realm. This had a dual purpose: one, the dreamers and their sleep had to continue their usual existence without disturbance. Two, the dreams and nightmares needed the distraction. They needed to surround themselves, even for small fractions of time, in the familiarity of their purpose. They found reinvigorating peace in their usual duties, just like Hob did in his classroom.

Still, he wanted to fight more.

It's not like he could do something to change his schedule despite how willing he was to launch himself into battle 24/7. The rules of the arrangement were rather clear. He'd go to sleep at night. He'd appear on the battlefield, fully equipped with his longsword and maille armor. Sometimes he'd have a horse—an imposing beast with a rich black coat and flaming eyes. He called her Night Mare, because retaining one's sense of humour is important in war. He'd fight fiercely. Whenever he was wounded in a way that would've killed any other human, he'd wake up, like waking up just before you hit the ground in a dream about falling. Most of the times, this would happen when dawn was already breaking in London, and after tossing and turning without being able to fall back asleep, he'd give up and start his day. On some occasions, he'd fallen early in battle (cunning, high-ranking demons, bastards the lot of them) and had woken up two or three hours after he had fallen asleep. When this happened, sleep would come back to him, but it was always a deep sleep of peaceful, abstract dreams where he couldn't remember who or what he was, let alone march up to the Lord of the place and demand to be put back into the action.

He'd never made it unscathed through the night to find if he could remain in the Dreaming as a reward for not falling. This truly was a war beyond anything else he had ever seen.

At first, he deluded himself into thinking that dream-wounds are not real wounds. It was an incredibly naïve delusion for someone who knew The Sandman in person, had lived for 600-plus years, and was fighting what he knew to be the real Devil. The good news was that at least dream-wounds healed quite fast, even faster than Hob was used to, knowing himself to be a quick healer. Nevertheless, he started noticing new scars, the arm that had been ripped out of its socket by a lion-headed demon was sluggish for four days, the day after waking up from being poisoned he'd had to move around dragging the foot whose ankle had been bitten.

He wished he could fight more.

His students noticed the change. They pointed out his injured behavior. They gently coaxed him back into the present when he spaced out. There was less passion in his rants. There were Middle English expressions in his lecture on the Local Government Act. There was one comment from the back rows about Fight Club. He dismissed all worries, remarks, and suggestions. He loved each and every one of those little shits, but he didn't want to be here. He wanted to be knee-deep in demon ichor.

Whenever he found a rhythm in battle, it was easy to think, take the pieces he had picked up here and there and put them together. Desire of the Endless. Huh. They sounded like they should be a fun one, honestly. If _Death_ of the Endless could teach her little brother how to crack jokes and pick a random peasant to do a fun little experiment on, then one named Desire should be a riot. Then again, Hob's human logic would also say that one named Dream should be easy-going and whimsical. He knew about one percent or less of what there was to be known about the Endless he had met regularly throughout most of his life (and he knew himself to love). How could he guess anything about an Endless he'd never met?

From what he had picked up, Desire was not boring, but they were not the good type of fun, either. A _mean queen_, Hob's friends from the late 80s would've called them. _Queer and bitchy is not a personality_. They were the golden-eyed blonde he had seen on Dream's stained glass windows. They were relentless. Their rivalry with Dream stemmed from the fact that they resented the overlap between their realm and Dream's. They couldn't possibly be pulling the strings behind the invasion because of this or that Endless law. They most definitely were. They had been involved in Dream's imprisonment.

This last part made Hob scream as he drove his sword into a demon's central (out of five) torso, far enough that he ended up coated in ichor up to his elbow.

He sometimes saw Dream, the majority of times glimpses on the battlefield. Hob had been very wrong to assume he had been heading out to battle when Lucienne had handed him a sword. He never held a weapon, not in the traditional way. The shadows that bent around him were his weapons. He shapeshifted. He squeezed the life out of a demon with his bare hands. Hob had never seen his helm before, and that thing made him quake like any demon _wished_ they could make him quake. Every time he managed to spot Dream somewhere in the battlefield, his efforts redoubled. That creature, that beautiful, terrifying, impossible creature. He was ready to singlehandedly bring about Hell's downfall for that creature.

Fewer times, he'd actually get a chance to talk to Dream when the council held hurried meetings on the edges of the battlefield. They weren't precisely pleasant little chitchats. Dream: otherworldly, barely shaped like a person, black-eyed. Hob: impatient, brimming with adrenaline, covered in mud, blood and ichor. Hob would insist that he could fight more, let him fight more, stop keeping him away for so many hours. Dream would snap that he would do no such thing, that Hob was being reckless as it was.

"**I am already going against my very nature by using your sleeping hours for battle. You need to _rest_, Hob.**"

"I'll rest when I'm dead." Hob winked (causing some mud to get into his eye) and pulled on Night Mare's reins, galloping away towards his next victim. Dream's lips no longer twitched when he tried to soothe his scowls with humour.

His orders, if they could be called that, never came to him explicitly, but in the form of the situation he'd find himself in when he appeared in the Dreaming, mostly vis à vis the presence of Night Mare. Was he on foot with Night Mare nowhere to be seen when he appeared? Then his orders for tonight were to stand his ground and destroy any demons that came near. Did he appear already on her back, mid-gallop, or next to her, holding the reins? Then tonight he was going to cover more terrain, maybe circle the entire battlefield. If Matthew showed up at any moment, then he also reported on anything different he had spotted. If his agenda wasn't already full with his demands for more hours on the job, then he'd give Dream a piece of his mind about clear instructions. It was all like, well, a _dream_, where he just sort of knew what he was supposed to do, but he was conscious enough to doubt himself from time to time.

Tonight, Night Mare had been there when he appeared, and it felt like a scouting night. As he rode away from Dream (Dream's scowl burning in the back of his mind), he decided he was going to make a wide arc around the battlefield and find a good vantage point to examine the situation. He felt a bit silly doing so; he still didn't see himself as any sort of strategic genius, but Dream had said his insight would be most appreciated so insight he would bring.

At his command, Night Mare slowed down to a trot. He wasn't somewhere that could be considered a vantage point. It was a beach of black sands, lower than the grounds where most of the fighting was being done, so he saw less than before. Why had he come here? He couldn't explain it. He had just been drawn here, and considering the bizarre nature of how he got his orders, he didn't question it too much. He stopped Night Mare altogether and dismounted. The battle was towards the mainland, so to speak. He turned towards the sea.

On a rock surrounded by water, several feet away from the shore, sat a woman. She was naked, her auburn hair falling gracefully over her pale body. She was wearing a pearl necklace and had a matching pearl broche in her hair. When Hob met her eyes, she curled one finger in coquettish invitation.

Hob realized he had taken a step forwards when he heard a splash and felt the cold of the water through his leather boots. _Don't be so dense, Gadling,_ he reprimanded himself. _If you searched for the definition of "siren" in a dictionary, she'd be pictured next to it._

He could not hear her, but he saw her laugh before waving off her own invitation. _So cliché!_ she mouthed. She was most likely a dream, the dream of a sailor, and she had just wanted to have a quick laugh with the funny little man she had spotted on the shore. Continuing with their strange game of charades, she mouthed, _I'll do better!_ and did an exaggerated thinking gesture, eyes turned to the sky and index finger tapping her chin.

Hob was certain that he knew the man on the rock (for it was a man now). He was large and muscular, with skin toasted by a job outside. A job like plowing the fields day in and day out, fields near to Hob's own, that he would walk by on his way to town and they'd greet each other, then meet each other again in a tavern, where they would drink and laugh and keep drinking until the memory of being pressed against a wall in a dark corner with a hand down his breeches was so eroded that he could only guess it had been this man and not another.

This time, he caught his step halfway through and instead took a step back. He was starting to dislike this game, and wasn't there something else he should be doing? Why had he come to this beach? Wasn't he headed somewhere different?

She was back to what he thought to be her original form and pouting. _Too long ago?_ She rolled her eyes with her whole head so that Hob could spot it from where he stood. _I don't want to do it the easy way._ When she mouthed "easy", she swept a hand over her hair with a flourish, and it was suddenly black instead of auburn. She made a pantomime of reaching into the water and pulling something out, except she _was_ pulling something out, a black fabric that she then held in front of her body. She covered up to her nose with it, and it was right in the frontier between see-through and opaque so Hob could guess at the pale silhouette behind it but nothing more detailed than that. She shimmied her shoulders, and the fabric shimmied with her. The word "burlesque" popped up in Hob's brain.

She wiggled her eyebrows and her eyes turned from green to dark blue. She was too far away from the shore for something like that to be noticed from there, but Hob was now far from the shore, too. Maybe he should stop walking. Why? He didn't know. Maybe he should keep walking.

Her hair was getting shorter, and it was losing it's glamorous luster. It was messier now, starting to stand up in random angles. His face—the face of the man on the rock, he was a man again—was getting sharper, too, less alluring siren, more alluring vampire. A Lord that would woo you with prideful scowls and hidden smiles.

Bile rose up Hob's throat. Fuck, what in fucking hell? He stopped walking abruptly, but even as he did so he knew, deep in his gut: Too late.

There were claws grabbing him by the cheeks now, or long fingernails, or talons, he didn't know. The world was getting fuzzier around the edges. The creature's eyes were in front of him, and they weren't green or blue, but golden. He felt his legs give in, but the hand clutching his face kept him from falling.

"Oh, Dream," he heard a voice croon just before everything went dark. "You know I _always_ go for the heart."

## Chapter 9

Dream was everywhere. In the battlefield, fighting. In his palace, talking strategy with Lucienne. Visiting dreams, making sure everything kept running smoothly despite the war. He was used to this sort of omnipresence. Enjoyed it, even, because it was a reminder that he was no longer in a cruel cage within a binding circle. It was natural to him to have his essence spread around the Dreaming.

The first night Hob had shown up in his palace, he had suddenly been _just there_. Hob Gadling had wandered into his throne room (just like Rose Walker had recently done, too), and Dream was both angry and terrified. He knew it was too soon for another vortex, and he also knew that Hob was there because Dream's heart of hearts had been reaching out to him every single night since he last saw him in the Waking World. But Denial is such a wonderful thing that maybe it should be the eighth Endless. So Dream tried to stomp and yell and sneer his problems (his beloved) away. His want of protection, of having Hob vanish the Morningstar's armies for him like he had once done with Constantine's hired goons, it was as selfish as it was foolish. This was not a pair of human men with knives, but a hoard of beings from the darkest corners of Hell. If he could only reason with Hob...

But he could not reason with anyone when Hob was holding him like that and swearing oaths of love and loyalty to him. Hob didn't want to fight for the sake of fighting; Hob wanted to protect Dream, to kill for Dream. If this had happened at any previous moment in their relationship, Dream would've surely reacted similarly to how he had in 1889. This bag of meat and muscles and sinew, who may not die but can still bleed, protecting _him_, the concept of dreams personified? But this was not 1889 nor any time before that, and not only was Dream beginning to learn to keep his pride from destroying his relationships, he also craved safety like had never craved it before. (If Hob had been there, Roderick Burgess's death wouldn't have been an accident; Hob would have slammed his head against the glass himself. He would've shot Alexander Burgess with the same shotgun that had killed Jessamy.)

Maybe there was a part of him that knew himself to be making a mistake when he fulfilled Hob's wish, but when a newly-knighted Hob smiled at him, all doubts evaporated. This could be a good, nay, a _wonderful_ thing.

Hob was ruthless in battle, but he was also reckless. Wherever he went, whether on foot or on the horse Dream had gifted him (and Dream was still deciding if he liked the name Hob had given her), demons fell by the dozen, but not without injuring Hob as well. All Dream wanted was to have Hob with him in his realm at all times, but he knew he had to limit Hob's time in the Dreaming or else he would drive himself mad in battle. Clearly, Hob was not willing to give himself the rest his mind needed, so Dream had to intercede.

Despite his extended consciousness, Dream forced himself not to constantly observe Hob when he was in the Dreaming. It had actually been more of a decision taken with his council. With a particular member of his council. With Matthew, when he told him he was being "fucken creepy, boss". When Hob had ridden away after his quip that Dream had found, despite the man's immortality, in poor taste, Dream let him slip away from his awareness, partially to stop being "fucken creepy, boss", and partially to be petty. If Hob wanted to continue to throw himself headfirst into danger without rhyme or reason, so be it, but Dream wasn't going to bear witness to such idiocy.

He should've been watching. He should've known something was wrong. He should've realized something was amiss before spotting Night Mare galloping around the battlefield, riderless.

All of a sudden, his essence was in a single place again: standing in front of the horse, holding her reins and soothingly rubbing her neck. "**It's all right, She Who Brings The Twilight.**" (For this was the name Dream had given her when he had created her.) "**Just tell me what happened. Where is he?**" The mare continued to paw the ground, offering no response. "**Night Mare. Answer me.**"

Night Mare lowered her head. "I'm so sorry, my Lord," she replied. "I don't know what came over me. We rode towards the beaches on the far end of Your realm. There was a presence; it distracted him and terrified me. I ran away, I don't think he noticed, and when I came back he was gone." She was trembling now. "You trusted me with his safety and I failed You, Your Majesty. I am sorry."

He wanted to unmake her. What is the point creating a dream specifically to guard a dreamer if she could not do that single task?! Dream's hand tightened on her reins, and she groveled even more. A thought stopped him, **_Hob would be very upset._** He pried his hand away from the reins and tensely ordered, "**Stay out of the battlefield until I call upon you again.**"

With one last bow, she vanished in a cloud of sand. Dream did the same, and reappeared in his throne room.

Lucienne was waiting for him where he had left her in the middle of a sentence when his consciousness had folded itself into a single point in the Dreaming. He did not let her say the second half of that sentence. "**Where is Gault?**" He may have phrased it as a question, but it was a command that summoned the dream to the throne room immediately.

"Sir—" Both Lucienne and Gault spoke at the same time, and surely both of them were intending to offer some commentary about Dream's agitated state.

Dream interrupted them, "**Gather as many dreams and nightmares as you see fit for a search party. Do what you must to find him.**" He was pacing, he didn't know when he had started pacing, but when Gault opened her mouth to reply (probably to argue, there was no need for a reply, she should already be gone), he stopped dead in his tracks and turned to her. "**FIND HIM!**" His voice invoked the terror of a fevered man unable to awake from a nightmare.

Gault nodded a bow and flew away. Dream resumed his pacing.

"**I cannot find him, I cannot feel him. I did not sense him leaving the Dreaming, and yet he is _gone_.**" He pressed his palms to his eyes and let out a sound between a scream and a growl. "**I did this, I did this, I—**" His hands fell away and his eyes snapped open. "**Desire.**"

"You don't know that." Lucienne's voice, cold and direct, cut through the surge of rage pounding in his head.

He turned to her with a snarl. "**I don't know that? Who else would _dare_. Not even the Morningstar themself. My sibling will pay for this with their _head_.**"

Why did he keep around a librarian as counselor if she didn't have the decency to even flinch when faced with the King of Nightmares' anger? "That is exactly what you can't do, my Lord. You have not gathered enough proof of their involvement in this war, let alone Hob Gadling's—" Here she did swallow and bow her head. "Disappearance," she finished, almost a whisper.

Dream could feel himself unfolding again, becoming jagged shadows and grasping claws and bloodied teeth. "**I. Don't. _Care_,**" a shadow bellowed and a claw hissed and a tooth snapped. "**I will go to Desire and tear them apart until they tell me—**"

It started as it always did, with the slightest of pulls to the core of his being. A call to attention. Lucienne was watching him with curiosity. She did not understand why he had stopped talking or why his form had suddenly regained its more solid shape. She did not feel it. She did not hear the voice that rang around every inch of the Dreaming.

"Attend, brother dearest. I stand in my gallery and hold your sigil. I think it's time for some negotiations, don't you think?"
