# Let me be your knight

## Chapter 1

Hob had written a speech. At one point, he had sat down and he had written an honest-to-God speech. He had already bought himself one of those new IBM personal computers, but he hadn't developed the habit of using it, so pen and paper it was. He had grabbed pen and paper and had written down everything he was going to tell His Stranger when—no, _if_—no, _when_ he decided to show his face again.

He had started his speech with an apology about the lack of tact from his part. He had meant what he had said, sure, but he could've said it better. Then he had added a quip or two about how rude it was to leave _an acquaintance_ hanging without even a note to say he'd miss their meeting. He had a mobile phone now, too, if he wanted to call. And a pager. Then those "quips" had evolved into ranting about how he's _oh so sorry_ that his pride had been wounded, but that's no excuse to be an absolute piece of shit with no regard for the feelings of others, and if he thought he could just waltz back into Hob's life like nothing had happened, he had another thing coming. Then that already barely coherent rant had evolved into a string of curses and smudged ink. Hob had been very drunk at the time.

God knows where that written speech was now, and at one point he had even decided that, when the moment came, he wouldn't say a single damn thing. Let the bastard do all the talking, if Hob even deigned to acknowledge his presence.

The moment came. Tugged by the strings of Fate, Hob lifted his gaze up from the papers he was grading and there he was, his choice of goth outfit for this century consisting of a long black coat over a black shirt and black skinny jeans. His hair was a fucking mess, and there was something about the look on his face. Serious, sure, but not stern and pinched like it had been during previous meetings. There wasn't a shadow of proud arrogance that expected Hob to fall to his knees and beg for forgiveness for his imprudence. In fact, he looked hesitant.

All of Hob's resolve vanished in an instant. He smiled, he couldn't help himself. He could be headstrong in many other moments of his life; he could allow himself to have one weakness, one tall, pale, angular Achilles heel. "You're late."

Dear stars above, was that a smile he got in response? And the quietest of chuckles? "**It seems I owe you an apology. I've always heard it impolite to keep one's friends waiting.**"

And that was it for Robert Gadling. A meteorite could fall right outside the New Inn and he wouldn't even notice. He felt a new smile, wider and brighter, spread across his face as his friend, his _friend_, sat down across from him. And he did so in a way that was so uncharacteristically relaxed that Hob couldn't help but relax, too, easing back into the seat, fingers toying with his glass of beer.

(There was a small part of him that kept prodding, that growled lowly like a caged beast. That was it? An apology, sure, but no explanation? 33 years of heartbreak and alcohol, and no explanation? 133 years, if he counted the ones he'd been in denial. He did his best to ignore that part of himself.)

"Do you, uh..." Hob cleared his throat. "Do you want anything to drink?"

His Stranger still had a smile on his lips, somehow, impossibly. "**Just wine, thank you. Red.**" Now this dance he knew. He'd have a wineglass in front of him, almost as if he wanted to complete the human ritual of "being in a pub", but he'd never touch it. Hob could deal with such a familiar thing. He flagged down the waitress (Wendy, sociology student, 3<sup>rd</sup> year) and placed the order for his friend (_his friend_!). Why he made sure to order a good one when it would go untouched, he didn't know.

Then there was silence, and even with the beast inside of Hob, it felt comfortable. He knew he was going to be the one to break it. He'd start prattling about the past century (plus some years, 33, who was counting), and his friend would remain silent, listening to whatever bullshit Hob had to say. That was what he knew, what was familiar, but today was apparently opposite day, or "Fuck with Hob's perception of reality" day, because his friend spoke first.

"**Dream.**" A pause, long enough for Hob to wonder what the fuck was going on. "**Or Morpheus. Oneiros. Kai'ckul. Sandman. Take your pick.**"

"My... my pick?" There was something deep, deep, deep, deep, _deep_ inside of Hob whispering that he knew exactly what was happening, but he chose to ignore it because he didn't believe it. Whatever was happening was not what Hob thought (_hoped_) was happening. "O-Of what, exactly?"

The smile was a smirk now; the bastard was doing it on purpose. "**My name,**" he said simply, like he didn't know he was dumping a bucket of cold water on Hob's head. "**I could offer more.**"

Oh. So what was happening was what Hob had thought was happening. Okay. _This_ was happening. He was getting a name. Name<em>s</em>, plural. And he could take his pick, if he wanted to. He didn't want to. That wasn't his choice to make. He took a swig of beer for courage. "Which one do you want me to use?"

There was a millisecond of surprise in the other's expression. He quickly schooled it, though, and replied, "**Dream.**"

"Dream."

"**Dream of the Endless.**"

"Dream _of the Endless_? Tad dramatic, don't you think?"

"**I _am_ endless.**"

And what the _fuck_ do you answer to that. If you're Hob Gadling, you down the rest of your beer and mutter, "Aren't we all, brother." That got him a laugh. And it was wonderful.

"**Such insolence, thinking that just by being immortal you can call yourself one of us,**" Dream said, and his tone was playful. It was clear that he was joking, and yet... **_one such as I_**... The wording wasn't even that similar. Hob would've brushed it off as his nerves getting the better of him, if it wasn't for the way Dream immediately pressed his lips into a tight line and looked away. So. He'd heard it, too.

Wendy, bless her heart, chose that moment to set down Dream's drink. It should've been a tiny break in the tension, gone before Hob could take advantage of it to change the topic. That's what it should've been. By now, it was settled that today was not the day for "should've"s or "known"s or "familiar"s.

Dream took a sip.

He took the wineglass by the stem with fingers that looked even more fragile than the stem itself, swirled its contents around, sniffed it, and took a small sip.

What. The _ever-loving_ fuck was going on.

Dream was looking down at the crimson wine, watching it lap at the sides of the glass. When he spoke, Hob was sure he was speaking to himself, not even realizing he was speaking out loud. "**It's always the little things you miss.**"

And here comes Hob Gadling, Britain's undefeated champion at the art of putting his fucking foot in his mouth. "Am I a little thing?" The cheeky comment slipped out unchecked. Fuck. Here's to another 133 years of regret.

Dream's hand froze so abruptly that the wine sloshed and threatened to spill out of the glass. When he lifted his gaze to meet Hob's, there was steely determination in them. Not anger, not wounded pride, but it still made Hob's stomach knot with anxiety. His voice sounded even deeper when he said, "**I wouldn't call you that, my friend, but I did miss you. Missed our meeting.**"

Hob felt his only beer of the night surge back up from his stomach up his throat, around his brain, behind his eyes, and all the way down to his feet. He was on cloud nine. He was heartbroken. He had forgiven Dream the moment he walked into the New Inn. He was angry. He was confused. The word "miss" all of a sudden had too many meanings. _Of course you missed our meeting, you stupid bastard, you_ weren't there. _But did you also ache at the lack of it, from wherever you were, nursing your wounded pride and letting me stew in my pain for an extra 33 years?_ Hob closed his eyes (a feeble attempt at keeping his tears in check) before managing to push out two words. "Then why...?"

"**I know I owe you an explanation.**"

And then there was silence. Not a pause, not a buildup towards an explanation. Silence. Of course. Hob rubbed his eyes and let out a pitiful excuse for a laugh. So much for a straightforward answer. Like herding fucking cats...

"**I was captured and imprisoned.**"

Hob's eyes flew open. It was like a switch was flipped inside him. All of his pain, his self-pity, his anger at Dream, all of it flocked together into a single razor-sharp blade of anger pointed at a new nameless enemy. "Who?" he growled.

"**Hob...**"

"_Who?"_

"**They've all been dealt with.**"

"Good." Hob would never call himself a good man, and not wishing ill upon others was a rule of good men. He wished that whatever way they had been dealt with had been tenfold whatever suffering they'd put Dream through.

Dream's gaze was stern again when he reiterated his previous statement. "**It really did pain me to miss our last meeting, specially considering the way we parted in our meeting before that.**"

Another sad little laugh. "Yeah, I think that 30-plus years of imprisonment absolves you from that, dear heart." He'd never called him that before. Why was he calling him that? Why was he so keen in testing the limits today until he screwed everything up again? What would Dream-

"**A century. I was there for a century.**"

Hob thought he was going to fall off his chair with the wave of nausea that hit him. "Bloody _hell_, Dream." He steadied himself. "Are you okay?" Dream's eyes were suddenly elsewhere. Of course he wasn't okay. What a stupid question. To make up for it, Hob stepped up his game with a stupid action: he reached across the table and squeezed Dream's hand. "I'm here for whatever you need," he said softly.

The universe stopped dead in its tracks. Dream looked down at where Hob's hand was still on his own. Hob had the very foreign feeling that he was about to die.

Dream placed his other hand on top of Hob's. "**Thank you, my friend.**"

Hob had the very foreign feeling that he was being born again into a whole new world.

## Chapter 2

The moment ended a handful of seconds after it started, but it was enough for Hob to commit to memory how every inch of his skin that was in contact with Dream's felt. It hadn't been a brusque separation, either. Dream simply eased back into his chair, taking his hands with him. Pity. Hob didn't move his hand for a while, just in case.

"—and yeah, it's slowly becoming a state of constant surveillance, your vacuum cleaner contains a detailed floor plan of your home, it's all gonna come back to bite us in the arse sooner rather than later, but hey! We said the same thing about electrical lights, didn't we? Well, yeah, it might be worse this time around, but look at this! Once upon a time, you felt any sort of physical ailment and they'd stick a leech on you and call it a day. Now, a fucken shiny square is telling me to go for a walk before the day ends to reach my daily step goal!" A sweeping gesture at his watch. "I swear, this thing is going to have an artificial existencial crisis when the years pass and my heartbeat never stops. That is, if the damned things were built to last. I've had breeches that lasted longer than one of my new phones."

He had been rambling about the past century for quite some time now. It was dark outside (yeah, his watch was going to be angry at him about the step goal, but Dream took priority. Over everything.). He had three empty beer glasses in front of him, and in front of Dream was an empty wineglass. Hob hadn't even suggested he get a second; he didn't want to push the amount of miracles that could happen in one day.

He placed both hands on the table, leaned back, and caught his breath. He wasn't sure when he had adopted those series of gestures to end a rant, but he knew that his students recognized them as the signal to hit "Stop" on their phone's stopwatch. The little bastards timed him. He knew there was a spreadsheet somewhere with a detailed account of his personal records. Cheeky fuckers. He loved them so much. "So..." He had no idea what he wanted to say next. If this were one of their previous meetings, that would be it, after his recount of the century. Well. No. There was one more thing missing, if they were going to dance their usual dance. "Aren't you going to ask me?"

Dream furrowed his brow minutely as he processed the question, but when he understood, his little smirk was very similar to the one from right after the Constantine incident. Oh, how Hob loved that smirk. "**Hadn't we agreed that it was pointless for me to ask by now?**"

"Come on! For the sake of tradition, my friend!"

Dream's sigh carried frustration and affection in equal quantities. And a whole lot of theatrics. "**Fine.**" He eyed Hob like one eyes an annoying little pet who demands treats. "**Robert Gadling. Do you still wish to live?**"

Hob knew the question was coming. He had asked for it, for fuck's sake. He knew his answer; it had not changed in six hundred years. A three-letter word would suffice. But _no_. His reaction was a pair of fingerguns and "You know it, baby."

Why? Why the _fuck_ did he do that? Why the fuck did he _say_ that?

Dream was staring at him with a blank expression. Time to holster those guns, partner. "That..." Hob cleared his throat. "That means yes."

And Dream laughed. A huff of sound escaped his lips, and he placed a loose fist over it to hide it, but his eyes shone with mirth. "**You are insufferable,**" he said, and Hob felt himself drown in the affection those words carried.

Hob was tugging at his earlobe again, damned little tick. "Eh, you only have to deal with me once a century."

Dream glanced down at his empty wineglass, traced its edge with a pale finger once, twice, thrice, and raised his eyes to Hob again. "**Friends meet more often than centennially, yes?**"

Hob's throat felt dry. A fourth beer was sounding quite enticing all of a sudden. Tread very carefully, Gadling. "Friends do, yes," he stammered.

Dream nodded slowly. "**Then I shall do my best to come visit you soon, dear friend.**" He stood up, and then this man, god, _being_ awarded Hob one last miracle: "**Shall I walk you home?**" Dream's lips twisted into a playful little smile. "**To appease your _square_?**"

Well, that sounded just lovely, except— "I live upstairs, mate," Hob replied with a sheepish grin, and Dream looked positively shocked, his mouth a perfect "o". "Yeah, it was the easiest solution, I already owned the land, couldn't be arsed to deal with even more real estate."

"**You own... this land?**"

Hob was able to divert his hand before it tugged at his earlobe yet again, running it through his hair instead. "Yup. Spotted it, bought it, had the New Inn built on top of it," he said. _For you,_ he didn't say.

_For me,_ Dream's shocked faced seemed to say. "**I-**"

Hob couldn't bear to hear whatever was going to come after in that sentence. "You can walk me to the stairs," he cut in, pointing to the door next to the bar.

This day had been so bizarre that when Dream's shocked expression morphed into a smile, normalcy was restored into the world. "**Lead the way**," he said with a tilt of the head that was almost a bow, if one such as Dream of the Endless would ever bow to one such as Hob Gadling.

## Chapter 3

When Dream had said he'd try to visit him sooner than 2089, Hob expected to see him in 50 years, turning their meetings into a semicentennial occurrence and patting himself in the back for doing such a good job at playing the part of normal friend. Instead, Dream showed up at his office a little more than a month later.

Hob, as seemed to be his custom, started talking before he was done thinking. "How did you know where— right, Endless, whatever, don't answer that, not that you were going to answer anyway."

Dream's rigid stance and expression were solemn as ever, but there was a hint of taunting in his voice when he said, "**"Hello, Dream. How are you, Dream? How have you been keeping, Dream?"**"

Hob pointed at him with a plastic fork that still held the cherry tomato he had been about to indulge in when he had sensed a pair of eyes (_that_ pair of eyes) watching him from the open doorway. "I don't know who taught you how to be funny, but I'd like to have a word with them. I don't think they realize the horrors they've unleashed into the world." He popped the tomato into his mouth before gesturing at the empty chair across his desk. "Close the door behind you, will you? This is technically my lunch break, but I like to keep an "all hours are office hours if you see my door open" policy for the kids, in case they need something."

After doing as he was asked, Dream slid into the offered chair. Once again, his posture was so at ease that Hob felt a sparkle of pride knowing his friend felt like he could relax around him. "**That honor would go to my older sister, I am afraid,**" he retorted to Hob's banter, "**if you want to take your complaints up to her.**"

Hob could've choked on the piece of lettuce he had just put in his mouth. He could've sputtered, freaked out, demanded more information, but he decided that no, he wasn't doing that today. "Right. You have a sister. Of course. Endless, too, I presume. Obviously. No doubt about it. Still no bleeding clue what any of that means, but live and let live, right?"

Dream tilted his head in a way that Hob would've called adorable if he were looking to get his tongue ripped out of his skull by a god. "**Has the ever-curious Hob Gadling run out of questions?**"

"The ever-patient Hob Gadling is done asking questions he won't receive an answer to, as a little bit of self-care, to adopt the sayings of the century."

"**I cannot wait to see how long _that_ lasts.**"

"Eat shit, mate." Dream's eyebrow climbed up a good inch, and Hob feared that he had gotten a bit too comfortable in their new comradery, but Dream didn't storm out. Look positively pissy, he did, but he stayed put, so Hob guessed he was in the clear. "Apologies. Eat shit, milord."

Dream pursed his lips. "**I wonder if knowledge about who I am would make you choose your words more carefully, but I fear that that is a lost cause.**"

As he put his now empty salad container back into his bag, Hob let out a dramatic sigh. "You could try, but I must warn you: I've already drawn up a pretty good picture of who you are with the names you gave me last time, and I'm still not very careful with what I say."

Dream's pissy mood uncoiled just a smidge. "**You've become quite a scholar, haven't you?**"

While the (almost) compliment was pleasant to receive, Hob felt it was his duty as liaison for humanity before Dream of the Endless to clarify a thing or two. "Mate," he began slowly, "I just needed to know how to google shit." He pulled his laptop closer from where he had pushed it aside to eat, opened a new browser tab and typed in "morpheus". He turned the laptop around so the screen was facing Dream. "There. From putting it all together, I figured you are some sort of god of sleep."

Without paying any attention to the screen (huh, Hob would've thought that in his vanity he'd love to read about himself), Dream let out a shallow laugh, "**A _god_.**" He sounded extremely amused, as if his good friend Hob were taking the piss by calling him such a lowly name. "**You think me so fleeting, Robert?**"

Well. Shit. Hob thought he had had a good guess there. Fuck him, apparently, for considering that his immortal, proud, powerful friend was something as meager as a _god_. "You said you were Endless," he answered stupidly.

"**And gods are not.**" Obviously. Gods? Endless? Ha! Laughable idea. "**And immortal human men...**" He let his words hang between them, a smirk on his lips.

Hob slammed his laptop shut, but any anger the action could convey was evaporated by his wide grin. "Fine, fine, I get it, we are all but shit beneath your Endless Doc Martens." Another tilt of the head. "Your boots." Damn him to Hell but he had been right, Hob couldn't help but be his usual curious self. "I yield. What, exactly, does it mean to be Endless?"

Dream, damn him to Hell and back, gave himself a moment to bask in his victory, and then he rearranged his long legs so that the ankle of one was resting on the knee of the other. "**You catch me in a good mood, my friend,**" he basically purred, and the contented sound combined with the knowledge that, despite everything, his friend could still have good moods made the corners of Hob's lips twitch. "**We of the Endless, for there are seven of us, predate your kind, your gods, and your world. I am the Lord of the Dreaming, Creator of Dreams, King of Nightmares, Shaper of Forms. I contain the entirety of the human unconsciousness. Whensoever you sleep, you enter the Dreaming. The Dreaming is me, and I am the Dreaming.**"

Hob was glad for his previous research because, as it was, he felt like his brain was melting into goo, even when he had already coached himself mentally to accept that his Stranger turned friend was a god. And then it turns out that "god" fell short of the mark, and that little speech...

"Christ's fingernails..." Now there's a phrase he hadn't used in a while. "So, uh-" Hob paused and swallowed, trying to find his voice, his real voice, not that pitchy excuse for a sound. "So you are Dream. And, uh, your sister? The one who taught you how to be funny? Who is she, Humor?" He hoped that Dream understood that he was being earnest and not trying to insult another Endless, one he hadn't even met.

No insult had ocurred, judging by the soft smile that appeared on Dream's lips. "**She'll be amused to hear you said that,**" he murmured, a mental note to himself, then added, to Hob, "**But no. She's Death. It is to her you owe your immortality.**"

And Hob had lost his big boy voice once again. "Give her my thanks, then," he squeaked.

"**I will, Hob Gadling,**" Dream answered with such finality that Hob sensed the end of his visit approaching. Which, by the way, begged the question—

"Hey, uh, bit of a change of subject, but I didn't catch the reason for your visit, my friend," Hob prompted, knowing full well that none have been given.

Just because Hob had every inch of that face memorized (and he liked to think that was a very normal thing for friends to do, thank you very much) was he able to catch the momentary awkwardness in Dream's expression. "**To visit you,**" he explained with a furrowed brow. "**To visit a friend**."

Something that ran warmer than his blood usually did started thrumming through Hob's veins. "A social call, then?"

"**Aye**," was the curt reply.

"Much obliged." Look at them, a couple of old men just spending some time together because they could, _a social call_.

Dream had stood up in that infuriatingly deadly silent manner of his. "**I should take my leave now.**"

Fighting back disappointment (he had gotten the chance to see him a mere _month_ after their last meeting, stop being greedy), Hob smiled. "It was nice to see you, old friend."

"**You too, Hob. I—**" It was still such a bizarre experience to see Dream act hesitant about anything. "**My Kingdom keeps me quite busy, but I'd like to see you again before our next set appointment.**"

"I'd love that." Hob no longer had to force his smile.

With one last nod to signal his goodbye, Dream turned towards the door and walked out. Hob heard an impossible rush of wind within the closed hallway and the telltale sound of shifting sands. It was kind of sweet of him, to say goodbye and use doors and walk away, even if he did end up causing a confusing situation for the cleaning staff to deal with later.

## Chapter 4

The next time Dream visited him, Hob feared for his immortal life.

First of all, the bastard didn't knock. Second of all, if materializing in a flurry of sand in the middle of his living room wasn't enough to scare the bejeezus out of Hob, the look of pure rage in his eyes finished the job quite nicely. Third of all, the pacing. He stepped out of his cloud of sand and began pacing, back and forth, saying nothing. Once his heart remembered that it wasn't allowed to kill Hob and began to beat again, his brain rebooted and his thoughts raced. Had he done something to piss Dream off so spectacularly? Said something? _Dreamt_ something? Shit, what had his subconscious come up with that—

"**My friend, I seek your council,**" Dream announced suddenly, halting in his pacing. Oh, wow. That was... new. Very new. And frankly, quite terrifying. Hob felt ridiculous, wearing sweatpants and an old T-shirt, holding a flowered dishrag and a chipped mug, and receiving a visit from Dream of the Endless, who **_seeked his council_**.

Dream was staring at him. Hob realized that seconds, maybe even minutes, had passed and he hadn't said anything yet. "Right. Uh, hi. Hello. Hi." Shaking his head, he slapped the dishrag over his shoulder and pointed at one of the stools on the other side of the counter that divided the living room from the kitchen. The action was so bartender-esque (he had tried it during the New Inn's first year) that what he said next was, "What can I getcha?" He ran a hand over his face. "Uh, no, sorry. I mean, what's troubling you, love? And yeah, sure, what can I get you? I don't have anything too strong up here, but I can always run downstairs if it'll help." Two sentences too late, he realized what had slipped out. God above, it was so fucking early, his mental faculties where probably still somewhere in Dream's realm, he could not be blamed for the shit he said.

Thankfully, Dream was too busy staring daggers at the floor to register anything that had been said, including the endearment. He did not take a seat. "**Can one forgive the man, but not the action?**" His voice was barely above a whisper, and shaking with unchecked rage. "**Even if it's necessary to free oneself from the burden of resentment?**"

Alright, no context, then. No matter, Hob could work with that. "Holding grudges is a horrid mistress, mate, specially when you live as long as we do. I don't—" He tapped the counter a couple of times, searching for the right words. "I don't know who he is or what he did or how you can separate man from action, but... it sounds like you do. And it sounds like you've also realized that he is not worth the trouble of your bitterness."

"**It is not my choice to make. It is not my forgiveness to dole out, either.**" He lifted his gaze to meet Hob's, and Hob felt his stomach climb up to his throat. The anger in those pupil-less, pitch-black pools was not meant for mortal eyes. "**She has already forgiven him, and I have ceased my punishment as I promised. I just wish to understand _how_ she could forgive him after what he did to her.**"

"And you came to me." Hob wasn't sure what he meant by that. On the one hand, yeah, why the fuck had Dream come to him? He had no clue what he was talking about and, considering his friend's metaphysical essence, probably wouldn't even understand if it were explained to him. On the other hand, _he had come to him_. He had needed a friend in his anger and frustration, and he had come to _Hob_. Oh, this was the type of thing that made a guy's heart dance a little jig.

Dream's eyes now had pupils, blue irises, and a very pained look. "**I apologize, I should not have burdened you with issues that do not concern you.**"

"Hey, hey, hey," Hob spoke like he was soothing a spooked cat, and he was walking out of the kitchen and around the counter, and he was taking Dream's hands in his, and Dream was not pulling away, and Jesus Christ, what was he doing? Helping a friend, right. That was it. "I am honored that you came to me for advice, Your Endlessness." He earned a minuscule twitch of the corner of Dream's lips for that, which he called progress. "And I wish I had more advice to offer, but I have never been a wise man. And your friend..." That was a fair assumption, right? One that would not earn him a sharp end to this conversation? "She sounds very wise. Maybe you should listen to her more often."

"**She is, and I should,**" Dream murmured. His eyes were burning holes in Hob's retinas, but it was still a disappointment when they fell to the floor once again. "**I never offered my condolences for your family.**"

Talk about coming out of left field, as the Americans say. Hob let go of Dream's hands in surprise, the heavy weight of old grief pressing down on his chest. It never left, not truly, it just became a part of him, another organ behind his ribs. It not always had weight, but when it did, it was enough to knock the wind out of his lungs. He felt tears stinging at his eyes.

Dream had not moved an inch, hands still poised where Hob had left them, like he hadn't even noticed the reaction his words had caused. In fact, he continued in the exact same murmur, "**Does it help to grieve them?**" Before Hob could comprehend what was being asked, Dream was pinning him down with those eyes again, but this time there wasn't just a glint of unshed tears hanging from the edge, but two wet streaks down Dream's cheeks. "**If I allowed myself to grieve my son, would the pain stop?**"

Hob's already pained heart shattered into a thousand pieces. "Dear heart, look at me," he said, and gestured with a trembling hand to his tear-filled eyes and his chest, because maybe Dream of the Endless could see through flesh and muscle and bone and find knots of grief. "No, it would not stop. But it does help. It helps make the grief a part of you, because it's not going anywhere, but you can at least stop its weight from pulling you under every second of every day. The pain means they mattered. All of them. Eleanor, Robyn, the baby..." He let his words hang because there were many names of lovers and friends that could continue that list, but now was not the time to do that, not when his friend needed him.

"**Orpheus,**" Dream whispered, and Hob realized he was adding a name of his own to the list. He still hadn't moved his hands, and Hob could fool himself and interpret that as waiting for Hob to take them once more. He could do that, but there was something else he wanted to try before.

When Hob brushed away his tears with the pad of his thumb, Dream let his eyes flutter closed, all beautiful, long eyelashes and flawless eyeliner. How could he always look so fragile? He wasn't, of course, but Hob felt like he could shatter under the lightest of touches, but he wouldn't, obviously, he was Endless, he could shatter _Hob_ with a _thought_, there was nothing a mere human could do that would even begin to hurt him, but if there was anything out there that could do any harm to Dream, Hob would track it down and tear it limb for limb, if it had limbs, and if it didn't, there were other things Hob could do.

"**She was right about this, too.**" The deep rumble of Dream's voice drew Hob out of his thoughts. "**About needing to grieve him properly. And I guess that means that you were right, too. My wife _is_ very wise.**"

If one were to write a list of things one does not want to find out about a friend while gently caressing said friend's cheek, the fact that there is a Mrs. Dream of the Endless would be pretty high on it. Hob froze. Shit fucking damn it to Hell, what was he doing? Six hundred years he had survived by only gazing upon this glorious creature, and then in the span of months under this new routine of more frequent visits, he had decided he could get his hands all over him and call him sweet little names. _Love_. _Dear heart_. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Hob stumbled backwards, his now free hand clinging to the dishrag on his shoulder like a lifeline. A _dishrag_ on his shoulder, and he thought himself worthy of touching Dream of the Endless. Stupid, stupid, stupid. "She does, uh," he stammered, "she does sound that way, yes. I, uh..."

"**Hob...**" Dream was staring at him again with his big, wet eyes that always seemed to contain so much emotion, much more than the rest of his body every conveyed. He reached one hand forwards, and Hob took another stumbled step back. "**Hob, we parted ways thousands of years ago. She was my wife once, and I still sometimes refer to her as such, but by all meanings, we are no longer husband and wife.**"

And the fact that Dream felt the need to clarify _that_ was giving Hob ludicrous ideas about Dream's intentions. And even if he wasn't misunderstanding him, even if he really... No, how could Hob act on it now? What kind of dickwad receives a friend in need, a friend suffering from something that had happened to his (ex)wife and from the loss of a son, and thinks, "Yeah, sure, this is the perfect time to make a move"? Before he could do something stupid, he stepped aside to provide Dream a clear path to the door, seeing how he was so fond of using them despite there being no need. "I hope I've been of assistance, my friend." Before, he would've killed to have his Stranger visit him for more than a couple of hours once a century. Now, he was cutting one such visit short.

He had forgotten one little detail, and that is that no one denied the King of Dreams anything, not even one's hand when he reaches his forward. Closing the distance between them, he placed the hand he had offered before over Hob's, damp dishrag be damned. "**Just by existing you have provided me more assistance over the centuries than you could ever imagine. I need you to know that. I've treated you unfairly in the past because of my foolish pride, but I don't want to do that anymore, even—**" He tightened his jaw slightly, something in his eyes revealing that the battle against his pride was not over yet. "**Even if it scares me. Hob...**" His other hand joined the first. "**Hob, if you return my affection—**"

**_Return my affection_**, how could he be so damn cute when he talked all solemn with his deep voice and fancy words. "Darling, you are hurting—"

"**And you always know how to make me feel better.**"

"—and I'm very glad that is the case, but," God, was he really about to say this? "can we put a pin in this?" Not being a saint of unbreakable convictions, he raised Dream's hands to his lips and brushed a kiss across the knuckles. "Save this conversation for peaceful times?"

"**Peaceful times**." Dream said the words like their meaning was foreign. "**Even if those are far into the future?**"

Hob offered him a small smile. Grief sometimes made you feel that way, but peace had the stubborn habit of returning; Hob had seen it do so many times. "Hey, I'm a patient man, but either way, they can't possibly be that far away."

Dream sighed with exasperation, as if Hob was being particularly thick. "**They very well can be, when one's kingdom is at war with the forces of Hell.**"

## Chapter 5

Hob had read somewhere that we are never just our current age. Every year we live piles on upon the ones before it, adding our experiences in such a way that we can never just be _this_ age. We are everyone we've ever been, all at once. As someone with so many years to add up, Hob enthusiastically agreed. The good and the bad, all 667 years, all of it was Hob Gadling, with all of those moving parts surfacing and falling into obscurity across time.

For example, right now, he was once again a medieval peasant, wishing he had his mother's bone rosary to cling to as a pretty massive crisis of faith crashed over him. Sure, he had abandoned all semblances of religion around, oh, 1524? but there are certain names you never forget to fear, even when you stop believing in the existence of the entity they belong to. And then your friendly neighborhood anthropomorphic personification of dreams flips that over on its head.

"So... Lucifer Morningstar is not only very real... but he holds a personal grudge against you and is invading your kingdom because of it."

They had moved to the couch at some point. There was a big mush of colors and sounds were Hob's memories of that process should be, but the point is that that's where they were now. Hob had his face in his hands, and through the gaps between his fingers he could see Dream sitting very stiffly a respectful distance away. The Lord of Dreams and Nightmares, telling him about Satan, all while sitting in his shitty little IKEA couch.

"**_They_ hold a personal grudge against me,**" Dream corrected instead of saying, for example, "I'm fucking with you, mate, of course they're not real."

Hob rubbed his face for the umpteenth time in the past half hour. "Sure. What _can't_ queer people do these days? Go us." The look Dream shot him managed to be both confused and annoyed. Feeling some life return to his legs, Hob decided to stand up and walked over to the kitchen. Reaching under the counter, he pulled out one of the few bottles of liquor he kept upstairs and two crystal tumblers. As he stared at the amber liquid, he realized that, no, this would not be enough, but he had promised himself— Wait.

"You don't have lungs, do you?" Dream's expression was definitely just confused now. Yeah, he probably didn't.

Hob opened one of the cabinets over his small stove, moving aside some of the spice jars so he could reach behind them and all the way back, feeling around until— Et voilà. It was a bit of a challenge to get the lighter to work with shaking fingers, and a second challenge to hold the flame steady, but soon enough he was blowing all of his problems away in a little gray cloud, head tilted back, cigarette held elegantly between index and middle finger. Like riding a bike.

"**That is absolutely disgusting.**"

"Shut up, I'm coping."

"**The man who sang praises for the chimney, now willingly bringing smoke into his home.**"

"Dream, love, I really need you to shut up for a second."

"**You know those things—**"

"Will kill me? Is that what you were going to say?" After another long drag, Hob leaned forwards on the counter to stare at Dream. "I started when it was in fashion. I stopped when I learnt about secondhand smoking. You don't have lungs. _Please_ let me have this before I break down crying over the existence of Hell."

"**I _do_ have a sense of smell,**" Dream grumbled, but otherwise dropped the matter entirely.

There was a blissful silence in the flat after that. The only sounds were Hob's inhales, pulling in, in, in, deep into the lungs, filling them with the stuff, hold, hold, hold, out in a long exhale, smoke curling out his nose and mouth. Could he still do smoke rings? He gave it a try with the next exhale. Crooked, unstable O. He'd have to try again. His next exhale came with a word: "Whoooo..." A bit less crooked, a bit less unstable. "Are..." He had forgotten to properly administer his smoke, so all that was left for this second word was a sad little puff. Laughter overtook him, quickly replaced by a cough. "Y-You," he finished amidst his coughing. Once all the smoke was out of his lungs and he had taken a good, clean deep breath, the cough subsided. "Bloody magical caterpillar," he chuckled under his breath.

"**I am starting to worry about your mind's stability.**"

Right. Dream. Hob had had his selfish little respite, but it was time to get back to the matter at hand. "M'alright, nothing to worry about, just getting my wits all sorted out again with a bit of fun." He grabbed both tumblers from the counter, shifting around the one in his right hand so it didn't catch any ash from his cigarette. "Doing a bit from _Alice_, dove, don't worry, I know who _you_ are, at least now I do." His ramblings were probably not helping paint a picture of perfect mental stability. Eh. He'd run out of steam eventually. He placed one tumbler (left hand, certifiably ash-free) on the coffee table in front of Dream, who watched him with a wrinkled nose, either from the offer of liquor, the proximity of the cigarette, or both. A very lordly look, very... 1589? Before he ran off? Hob eased back into his end of the couch. "Sorry, I needed a minute there. Right. Back to where we were. Hell. War. Right. How can I help?"

Dream's dignified disgust disappeared when he frowned. "**Help?**"

"Yeah, how can I help? I'm guessing this invasion is taking place in a different part of the Dreaming from the one I visit every night 'cause I haven't noticed anything amiss. I'm going to need a couple of pointers to get to the battlefield, my liege."

With a voice that had shifted down a couple of octaves in a very inhuman way, Dream enunciated coldly, "**You. Are _not_. Fighting.**"

Well, then. The King had spoken. Nothing to do about it. Unless you're Hob Gadling. "Yeah, I fucking am. I have the experience, I'm in, uh, decent shape, and most importantly: I can be there for you for this. I wasn't there—" No, he still couldn't say it. "I wasn't there last time; let me be there this time. I _need_ to be there this time."

Dream stood up abruptly, all white-hot fury and **_then I shall take my leave of you and prove you wrong_**. Hob swallowed, but did not break eye contact. "**I will _not_ have you fight in a war that does not concern you. Not for me. Not for anyone.**"

"First of all, that's how wars work, that's their whole point, putting some guy that barely knows what's going on in the front. Trust me, I've been that guy quite a few times." Hob finished what remained of his drink, dropped the cigarette into the tumbler, and stood up to be eye to eye with Dream. "Second of all, this one is the exception. It very much does concern me because it concerns _you_. I know there's still that conversation we haven't had, but I..." He sighed, unsure of how to word the turmoil inside of him.

"**If you say you'd die for me, I'll know your words to be hollow, Hob Gadling.**"

Hob smiled, not in a way that reached his eyes but in a way that had charmed lovers, law enforcers, commanding officers, and barkeeps across the centuries. "I'd kill for you. How's that, huh?" He sealed the deal with a wink.

Dream was not swayed. "**This war is beyond your comprehension, even with your "experience".**"

On the one hand, understatement of the millennia, Hob could barely begin to wrap his head around the idea of the Dreaming, and he couldn't picture the enemy beyond caricatures and pictures drawn in chapel walls to force him to remain pious. On the other, the Hob that fought in Burgundy would have a fit equal to one from learning about the existence of Lucifer if he learnt about tanks, let alone the atom bomb. And then he'd down his ale and run into the battlefield. He's stupid like that. "I'm an adaptable man, you know that about me."

Dream held his gaze, but said nothing for a beat. He was running out of arguments, but he was also as stubborn as Hob. Unstoppable force meets immovable object, alright. Finally, with a softer tone, he said, "**There is a way you can help me.**"

Hob's eyebrows shot up. "Oh?"

"**Be here. Let me come back to you after the war. Let me look forward to seeing you again, and let that be what keeps my strength up, just like it has for the past six hundred years.**"

Hob still had some words left to say to _that_, but it's rather hard to argue with a swirl of sand slowly settling on your living room floor. His second option after arguing was to make his way through the rest of the pack, but when he turned towards the counter, there was just a small pile of sand next to his lighter. Absolute bastard.

## Chapter 6

This was definitely a perfect evening. He was sitting under a huge oak tree that shielded him from the rays of the setting sun. The apple in his hand was crisp and juicy. He had been playing Animal Crossing for hours with no interruption. Just this morning, a sign had been posted in the town square announcing the definite end of all flea-kind from here to eternity. A young maid walked by with a pail of wine from the nearby spring. At Hob's "How fare ye?", she giggled and blushed. Now, that could prove interesting. He could put his Nintendo down and let her lead the way to the nearest barn.

Huh.

Something was not quite right with that picture. No, that was ridiculous. It was the perfect evening. What could possibly be wrong? Yet something inside him insisted and tugged at his mind. Something was off. Think, Robert, think. What do Nintendos in the fourteenth century and springs that flow with wine have in common?

"Shit, I'm dreaming." Both the Nintendo and the apple immediately vanished. He forced himself to calm down; he couldn't afford to startle himself awake. It had been two weeks and three days since he had last seen Dream. Ever since then, he'd go to bed every night determined to have lucid dreams (he read a lot about it online) so he could look for the bastard in his own turf. He had failed every night, until now.

Hob stood up and looked around. The tranquil British countryside remained stubbornly unchanged. "Hullo, Lord of the Dreaming?" Nothing. "Come on, come _on_. I have to see him." There, in the corner of his eye, a ripple. "_Please_. I need to see him. Let me see him. Take me to your leader or whatever. Please." Everything paused. The wind rustling through leaves, the swaying blades of grass, the sounds from the town just over the hill. There was doubt in that pause, and yeah, Hob could apparently sense doubt felt by a _landscape_. One more time, really drive the message home. "Please, I want to help."

And that was it, the world around him shuddered and rippled. The sky burst at its seams. Where there had only been idle clouds and the last golden rays of the day, nebulas and galaxies now pushed through unseen tears in the firmament to swallow his dream whole, whisking him away to who knows where, where he'd—

"Wait!"

Another pause, hesitant and confused.

With his right hand standing by at the ready, Hob focused on the memory of the weight on his hip until it became a reality, and his hand wrapped around the hilt of his longsword. "Okay, I'm ready. Let's go."

---

When the universe regurgitated him, he was standing within the most impressive room he had ever seen or could've ever imagined. Gothic columns rose high into a vaulted ceiling that wasn't a ceiling at all, but the whirling collection of nebulas and galaxies he'd seen before. Each column carried the bust of some fantastical creature or another. At the end of the room, there were three stained-glass windows depicting... well, it was hard to describe what they were depicting, for they were _alive_, pieces of glass shifting around to form now a bizarre map, now a person with short blonde hair and bat wings, now _another_ blonde person with golden eyes. In front of them rose a twisting staircase that led to a platform that held a single black throne. Ah. A throne room.

All of that was very impressive and whatnot, but Hob's attention was entirely elsewhere. There was a man standing in the middle of the room with his back turned to Hob. He seemed... _different_ here, in his realm, instead of out there in Hob's reality, but Hob would know that hairdresser's nightmare of untamed black hair anywhere. Next to him was an impeccably dressed woman with dark skin, glasses, shaved head, and pointed ears, but maybe that last part was a trick of the light. Or maybe not. He was dreaming, after all. She was staring at Hob with her eyes wide like saucers.

"My Lord," she began hesitantly, and Dream made a noncommittal noise, still not turning around. "There is a, uh, a—"

Anyone who worked for Dream deserved all the help they could get (and probably a raise), so Hob swooped in to her rescue. "A Sir Robert Gadlen, at your service, Your Majesty." He bowed with an exaggerated flourish that would've suited the entitled prick he had been when he wore that title (but hey, legally a knight! That's the kind of shit that really polishes a CV). Dream had somehow managed to stiffen his posture even more, so Hob chuckled nervously, "I'm kidding, it's me. Hob. Just Hob. Gadling, not Gadlen. You know. Hob. Little old me." The woman was shaking her head from side to side very slowly. Hob decided that the best moment to shut his mouth had been like two minutes ago, and the second best was right now.

"**_How_**..." The word was a venomous hiss that made the stained-glass windows rattle. Dream clenched his fists and Hob had the terrifying impression that his entire form undulated like liquid shadow before regaining its solid consistency. He spun around and the light from the night sky above them hit him just right. Hob swallowed. May the Lord have mercy on his immortal soul, Dream was dressed for battle. He was wearing a black robe and a fitted black leather cuirass. Between the outfit and the angered expression, his face looked sharper, gaunter, and it was breathtakingly beautiful. Undisturbed by the lovestruck expression Hob knew himself to be wearing, Dream continued, "**How are you here, Robert Gadling?**"

The woman closed her eyes and pinched her nose, but Hob merely shrugged. "I have no bloody clue, if I'm honest. I just asked nicely to see you and here I am. So to answer your question: with good manners and good looks?"

It was the first time Hob heard him laugh louder than a huff, easily lost in a noisy tavern, but Dream's laugh was as loud as it was lifeless. "**Splendid. I am at war, and now I have to concern myself with the appearance of another vortex as well.**" Hob had no idea what that meant, but there was a flash of pain in Dream's eyes.

"My Lord, if I may..." When the woman spoke, Dream glanced at her as if they both knew that he was going to let her talk and he was not going to like a word of it. This was clearly the way things worked around here because the woman was unfazed. "Sir, there cannot be another vortex so soon after the last, you know this. I don't think this dreamer has the ability to will himself into your throne room. He is not here by a power of his own."

"**Then by whose power is he here, Lucienne?**" Hob was starting to get tired of being talked about like he was an interesting little bug that had flown in.

"I think..." The woman, Lucienne, hesitated. "I think the Dreaming wanted him here." She had to know she wasn't fooling anyone with her choice of words. **_The Dreaming is me, and I am the Dreaming,_** Dream himself had told Hob so.

"**The Dreaming wanted him here,**" Dream repeated. "**Well, what it wants is of no consequence, I will not put him in harm's way, and Hob, by the stars, why on Earth are you raising your hand?**"

"Because I want to talk now, and I've been spending too much time in classrooms lately."

Dream really tried to control the way his scowl almost twitched into a smile then, but Hob was able to catch it. "**Speak, _Professor_ Gadling.**"

"First of all, you jest, but keep calling me that and see where that takes you. Second of all, I've thought a lot about what you said about waiting for you to come home from the war, and I'm sorry, but that's really not my style, I'd rather be by your side throughout it. And third of all, you owe me a pack of cigarettes."

Dream mockingly raised an elegant finger for each of the items Hob had listed as he answered them. First finger: "**I might.**" Second finger: "**You won't be.**" Third finger: "**No, I don't.**"

Hob crossed his arms over his chest. "You keep saying that, but the Dreaming _and_ your counselor think I should fight for you." Lucienne startled, clearly not happy with being dragged into their spat.

"**She's my librarian, not my counselor,**" Dream retorted, narrowing his eyes, "**and if she does think that, then she does not realize that what matters is that you remain out of danger.**"

Okay, they were just going around in circles now. "_You_ want me here, Dream!" Hob exclaimed. "Or else I wouldn't be here! She said so, you know so, and I'm still not sure how this fucking place works, but I know enough to know so, too!"

"**And I already said that what I want is of no consequence!**" Dream's voice boomed in the large throne room, making Hob's teeth shake. "**You will not be put in harm's way just because I had a whim to be protected by some... _peasant-knight_.**" He gestured with a grimace at Hob's cotton tunic and longsword combo, as if the insult would distract him from what he had just admitted.

"There's nothing wrong with wanting to be protected," Hob said gently.

So much emotion danced in Dream's eyes at that moment that it wasn't a surprise when he turned his back on Hob once again. "**Maybe so, but it does not excuse—**"

His words died in his throat when Hob wrapped his arms around his waist. God bless the Dreaming, Hob had only needed to think about taking a step forwards and all of a sudden the space between them was nothing. With his forehead resting against the back of Dream's head, Hob pressed a feather-light kiss to the nape of his neck, delighted at the resulting shiver. "Let me be your knight." He nosed at the short hairs there as Dream melted into his embrace. "Let me protect you from anything that tries to hurt you." He pressed another kiss to the spot behind Dream's ear. "Let me kill anything that lays a finger on you."

Dream's already deep voice had a whole other dimension with Hob's chest pressed against his back. "**I thought you wanted to postpone this conversation.**"

"Oh, that conversation is still happening later, mister. This is all pre-conversation shit. This is just what mates do," Hob snickered. "And don't change the subject."

"**You distracted me.**" Dream turned his head to the side, towards Hob, with lips slightly parted, but Hob took a step back. He wasn't sure if he was doing it because he still had some sort of resolve in him or to be a little shit. If it was the former, he was surprised at his self-control. If it was the latter, he was surprised at his ability to commit to the bit.

"Ah, ah. Careful. Post-conversation territory."

Dream glared pure poison at him over his shoulder before straightening his cuirass, which Hob hadn't even wrinkled. "**Lucienne, can you pass me a sword?**" And it's not that Hob had been so rude as to completely forget she was there, it was more like he had unconsciously assumed she had left the moment he had started nuzzling her boss.

Dream turned to face Hob as Lucienne handed him a pure black masterpiece of a weapon, the engraved hilt depicting a dragon, its tail curling around the knuckle guard, and an onyx stone decorating the pommel. Hob was sure Dream was about to dismiss him in his new favorite way (by vanishing before Hob could get another word in), but Dream was merely staring at him with a cocked head like he was a rather amusing kitten. Before Hob could bark something about Dream taking a picture so it lasted longer, Dream spoke, still very amused, "**I believe tradition dictates you kneel for this.**"

Oh. "Oh!" Hob began lowering himself down to his knees, but stop midway. "Wait, I didn't bathe, well, I did shower, I mean the ritual bath, and the vigil, and I need a moment to remember the words to the oath—"

"**_Hob_.**" Dream raised an eyebrow and gestured with the sword in his hand.

"Fine, fine, damn, someone's in a hurry." Hob knelt and bowed his head. He noticed, amused, that even in his battle regalia, Dream wore his Doc-Martens-style boots.

The sword felt ice cold through his flimsy tunic where it touched his shoulders.

"**Rise, Robert Gadling, knight of the Dreaming.**"

## Chapter 7

As Hob rose with the biggest smile plastered on his face, he noticed that Dream was watching him with a similar, albeit smaller, smile. It was already pretty unorthodox to get re-knighted in the Realm of Dreams, so Hob considered if he should break tradition even further and give his new King a big bear hug. He decided against it. It was unlikely he'd be able to control himself a second time, and there was a war to get to, and necking with the King right after one's knighting ceremony would be quite improper.

"So..." Hob wrung his hands. "What exactly am I fighting? And where? And also... _how_? Do I need some sort of special holy weapon to vanquish the hoards of Hell or...?" Dream pinched his lips into one of his prissy little scowls. "Hey, don't give me that look. I thought I'd just know all of that once I got here. Threshold of revelation, and all that. A blue streak of recognition."

Again with the tilted head and furrowed brow. Did he do it on purpose to be irresistibly cute? "**Threshold of what?**"

"Revelation. From _Angels_? _In America_? Have you read it?"

Dream sighed with annoyance. "**Why does everyone assume I've read or watched things that came out while I was imprisoned?**"

Shit. "Right, sorry," Hob apologized sheepishly. "I'll lend it to you someday, if you want."

There was a gleam of pride in Dream's eyes, like there was something he was just dying to show off about. "**That won't be necessary. My library—**" He stopped, remembering something. He turned towards his librarian who counseled him but who wasn't his counselor (just like Hob had once been the man he spent pleasant evenings in a pub with but who wasn't his friend). "**Lucienne—**"

"The council has assembled and is awaiting your arrival, My Lord," Lucienne answered the unspoken question with just the slightest hint of irritation that told Hob that the council had probably been waiting for a while now for their Lord to stop flirting with the new knight.

Hob hadn't even noticed that Dream had started looking more like he did on their Earthly meetings until his duties came rushing back and once again there was that _something_ that Hob couldn't put his finger on that made him look different. Dream shot Hob one last secret smile before nodding solemnly. "**Then I shall not keep them waiting any longer. Shall we, sir Gadling?**"

"Lead the way, my liege."

---

Firstly: the council was held in the library around one its tables. It all seemed very improvised for Hob for a realm where anything could be created with a thought, but he refrained from making a comment. Secondly: the council apparently consisted simply of Dream, Lucienne, a man with a carved pumpkin for a head (sure), and a beautiful woman with iridescent skin and butterfly wings (of course). There was also a raven standing on the table, but Hob wasn't sure if it was part of the council or not. He didn't want to ask, either, in case he offended His Excellency Sir Raven of the Dreaming Corvids.

Hob had been planning to hang back and silently watch the proceedings. He had never been the type to participate in war rooms. It was somewhat ironic. When he had participated in wars, he had always been yet another foot soldier, cannon fodder. During the time that he had been recognized as a knight, which would've meant a horse and a seat at the table, he was only called so because he had flashed enough gold to the right people, and he had seen no wars during that time. Too busy eating beyond his fill in lamb and hosting the Queen of England. The whole period was a bittersweet memory; he wished he had known Eleanor in better days.

And so he had planned to be but a humble observer, but then Dream had left a space between him and the iridescent woman, and he glanced at Hob for just a millisecond, hesitant. How could he say no to that?

"Oh, wow, a new guy," the raven said. Okay. His Excellency Sir Raven of the Dreaming Corvids, alright. Hob was glad he hadn't asked. "And a _dreamer_, that's interesting."

"**Matthew, this is Hob Gadling, my dear friend and now knight of this realm.**" Hob might've puffed out his chest a bit at that.

"A _friend_?" Matthew squawked, but he was quickly dismissed by the pumpkin-headed man.

"Yeah, yeah, we've all heard of your friend Hob, can we get on with it?"

Hob was starting to get the impression that this council was made up of people (and ravens) who were not likely to grovel and tell Dream only what he wanted to hear, which was, in his opinion, a sign of good leadership from Dream and also a probable source of entertainment for himself. Dream seemed to be seriously doubting both of these things at the moment. "**Mervyn... don't you have duties to attend to elsewhere in the castle?**"

The pumpkin-headed man shrugged (an odd-looking gesture that made Hob wonder if that thing was physically attached to his torso or just sort of placed there). "A war council made up only four beings seemed kinda pathetic, so I decided to drop by to see what I could do. You brought a plus one, maybe I can be Matthew's plus one."

"**Pathe—**" Dream momentarily closed his eyes and gripped the arms of his chair before continuing, "**Thank you for joining us, Mervyn Pumpkinhead, but let me reiterate that Hob is not my "_plus one_": he is a knight of the Dreaming and his insight will be most appreciated.**" That was all very sweet of Dream considering that a while ago Hob had confessed that he hadn't the bloodiest clue how he was supposed to participate in this war.

Hob grinned awkwardly. "Glad to be here." A pause. "What am I going to be fighting?"

"Hell's forces! Demons!" Matthew exclaimed, wildly flapping his wings and ruffling his feathers. "The immortal legions of the abyss! Lucifer Morningstar! Satan! The Devil in knee-high boots!"

"**That's enough, Matthew, thank you,**" Dream interrupted before the raven went into more detail about the Devil's wardrobe. "**The Lightbringer should not be our primary concern. Their entire history is plagued by failure.**" Hob wanted to argue that constantly failing or not, they were still Satan and still sounded like quite a threat, but Dream seemed to be building up to a much more important point. "**Our real concern should be the assistance they are most certainly receiving, or else they would not have been able to enter my realm so easily. An assistance that, I am certain, comes from my sibling.**" The last two words were gritted out through clenched teeth.

"An Endless is helping Satan?" Hob didn't realize he had spoken out loud until every eye (and hole carved in gourd) was on him.

"The ancient laws that bind even the Endless—" Lucienne began.

"**They are helping the Morningstar, I am sure of it,**" Dream snapped. "**They found a way around the laws, somehow.**" There was silence around the table. Matthew shuffled on his talons. Lucienne had pressed her lips tightly together, probably to physically stop herself from arguing back.

"If I may..." The woman's voice was soft, but firm. Out of the corner of his eye, Hob could see patterns swirling on her skin like an oil spill. He didn't dare to turn to look at her fully; he'd probably be mesmerized by the fluctuating colors and stare at her in a way that would be considered rather rude, specially considering... well, Hob was just going to say in his defense that all those years of puritanism and several layers of clothing had left a mark in him that he hadn't fully outgrown.

"**Speak freely, Gault.**"

"Even if Desire of the Endless is behind the scenes of this invasion, we should first focus on Hell's assault. The dreams and nightmares out there are not being torn apart by the question of your sibling's involvement." Gault's voice broke. "They are being torn apart by demons."

Dream's eyes were suddenly rimmed with tears, and Hob shuddered to think of the toll this war was having on his creations. Without thinking (as always), Hob wrapped a hand around Dream's bicep. He was about to draw back (what would the honorable council think of such familiarity between the new knight and their King?) when Dream covered it with his own and squeezed. "**I know. You're right. Thank you, Gault. Hob.**" Hob gave an answering squeeze and lowered his hand. "**I will continue to investigate Desire's involvement but without neglecting our offensive against Hell. I hope that the addition of a very skilled warrior helps turn the tide in our favor.**" He turned to look at Hob with such adoration that Hob feared he was going to be accused of nepotism.

Swallowing down the rising butterflies, Hob replied, "I'll try to live up to your expectations, milord." Could ravens smirk? Because Hob was sure Matthew was smirking at him.

"**It's morning now in your part of the Waking World. Wake, for now, and tonight, I'll see you on the battlefield.**" Hob opened his mouth to argue that he was ready to go _now_, he didn't care if it was morning, let him stay asleep for as long it was necessary, let others think he was a new case of _encephalitis lethargica_, he didn't _care_, but the words vanished from his mind when Dream pushed a strand of hair behind his ear. "**This dream is over.**"

## Chapter 8

It was an interesting time to be Hob Gadling. By day, he was a teacher. By night, he was a knight. Like fucking Batman, if Batman had an actual day job.

His reluctance to be sent back to the Waking World during the day diminished just a teensy bit when he learnt that he wasn't the only one working in shifts. The dreams and nightmares chosen to fight (nightmares of great violence and pain, dreams of protection, safety and healing) were not constantly on duty on the battlefield. On rotations, they were sent out to the rest of the Dreaming, to visit the different dreamers, to do the job they had been created to do and not the one they were forced to do by the horrors invading their realm. This had a dual purpose: one, the dreamers and their sleep had to continue their usual existence without disturbance. Two, the dreams and nightmares needed the distraction. They needed to surround themselves, even for small fractions of time, in the familiarity of their purpose. They found reinvigorating peace in their usual duties, just like Hob did in his classroom.

Still, he wanted to fight more.

It's not like he could do something to change his schedule despite how willing he was to launch himself into battle 24/7. The rules of the arrangement were rather clear. He'd go to sleep at night. He'd appear on the battlefield, fully equipped with his longsword and maille armor. Sometimes he'd have a horse—an imposing beast with a rich black coat and flaming eyes. He called her Night Mare, because retaining one's sense of humour is important in war. He'd fight fiercely. Whenever he was wounded in a way that would've killed any other human, he'd wake up, like waking up just before you hit the ground in a dream about falling. Most of the times, this would happen when dawn was already breaking in London, and after tossing and turning without being able to fall back asleep, he'd give up and start his day. On some occasions, he'd fallen early in battle (cunning, high-ranking demons, bastards the lot of them) and had woken up two or three hours after he had fallen asleep. When this happened, sleep would come back to him, but it was always a deep sleep of peaceful, abstract dreams where he couldn't remember who or what he was, let alone march up to the Lord of the place and demand to be put back into the action.

He'd never made it unscathed through the night to find if he could remain in the Dreaming as a reward for not falling. This truly was a war beyond anything else he had ever seen.

At first, he deluded himself into thinking that dream-wounds are not real wounds. It was an incredibly naïve delusion for someone who knew The Sandman in person, had lived for 600-plus years, and was fighting what he knew to be the real Devil. The good news was that at least dream-wounds healed quite fast, even faster than Hob was used to, knowing himself to be a quick healer. Nevertheless, he started noticing new scars, the arm that had been ripped out of its socket by a lion-headed demon was sluggish for four days, the day after waking up from being poisoned he'd had to move around dragging the foot whose ankle had been bitten.

He wished he could fight more.

His students noticed the change. They pointed out his injured behavior. They gently coaxed him back into the present when he spaced out. There was less passion in his rants. There were Middle English expressions in his lecture on the Local Government Act. There was one comment from the back rows about Fight Club. He dismissed all worries, remarks, and suggestions. He loved each and every one of those little shits, but he didn't want to be here. He wanted to be knee-deep in demon ichor.

Whenever he found a rhythm in battle, it was easy to think, take the pieces he had picked up here and there and put them together. Desire of the Endless. Huh. They sounded like they should be a fun one, honestly. If _Death_ of the Endless could teach her little brother how to crack jokes and pick a random peasant to do a fun little experiment on, then one named Desire should be a riot. Then again, Hob's human logic would also say that one named Dream should be easy-going and whimsical. He knew about one percent or less of what there was to be known about the Endless he had met regularly throughout most of his life (and he knew himself to love). How could he guess anything about an Endless he'd never met?

From what he had picked up, Desire was not boring, but they were not the good type of fun, either. A _mean queen_, Hob's friends from the late 80s would've called them. _Queer and bitchy is not a personality_. They were the golden-eyed blonde he had seen on Dream's stained glass windows. They were relentless. Their rivalry with Dream stemmed from the fact that they resented the overlap between their realm and Dream's. They couldn't possibly be pulling the strings behind the invasion because of this or that Endless law. They most definitely were. They had been involved in Dream's imprisonment.

This last part made Hob scream as he drove his sword into a demon's central (out of five) torso, far enough that he ended up coated in ichor up to his elbow.

He sometimes saw Dream, the majority of times glimpses on the battlefield. Hob had been very wrong to assume he had been heading out to battle when Lucienne had handed him a sword. He never held a weapon, not in the traditional way. The shadows that bent around him were his weapons. He shapeshifted. He squeezed the life out of a demon with his bare hands. Hob had never seen his helm before, and that thing made him quake like any demon _wished_ they could make him quake. Every time he managed to spot Dream somewhere in the battlefield, his efforts redoubled. That creature, that beautiful, terrifying, impossible creature. He was ready to singlehandedly bring about Hell's downfall for that creature.

Fewer times, he'd actually get a chance to talk to Dream when the council held hurried meetings on the edges of the battlefield. They weren't precisely pleasant little chitchats. Dream: otherworldly, barely shaped like a person, black-eyed. Hob: impatient, brimming with adrenaline, covered in mud, blood and ichor. Hob would insist that he could fight more, let him fight more, stop keeping him away for so many hours. Dream would snap that he would do no such thing, that Hob was being reckless as it was.

"**I am already going against my very nature by using your sleeping hours for battle. You need to _rest_, Hob.**"

"I'll rest when I'm dead." Hob winked (causing some mud to get into his eye) and pulled on Night Mare's reins, galloping away towards his next victim. Dream's lips no longer twitched when he tried to soothe his scowls with humour.

His orders, if they could be called that, never came to him explicitly, but in the form of the situation he'd find himself in when he appeared in the Dreaming, mostly vis à vis the presence of Night Mare. Was he on foot with Night Mare nowhere to be seen when he appeared? Then his orders for tonight were to stand his ground and destroy any demons that came near. Did he appear already on her back, mid-gallop, or next to her, holding the reins? Then tonight he was going to cover more terrain, maybe circle the entire battlefield. If Matthew showed up at any moment, then he also reported on anything different he had spotted. If his agenda wasn't already full with his demands for more hours on the job, then he'd give Dream a piece of his mind about clear instructions. It was all like, well, a _dream_, where he just sort of knew what he was supposed to do, but he was conscious enough to doubt himself from time to time.

Tonight, Night Mare had been there when he appeared, and it felt like a scouting night. As he rode away from Dream (Dream's scowl burning in the back of his mind), he decided he was going to make a wide arc around the battlefield and find a good vantage point to examine the situation. He felt a bit silly doing so; he still didn't see himself as any sort of strategic genius, but Dream had said his insight would be most appreciated so insight he would bring.

At his command, Night Mare slowed down to a trot. He wasn't somewhere that could be considered a vantage point. It was a beach of black sands, lower than the grounds where most of the fighting was being done, so he saw less than before. Why had he come here? He couldn't explain it. He had just been drawn here, and considering the bizarre nature of how he got his orders, he didn't question it too much. He stopped Night Mare altogether and dismounted. The battle was towards the mainland, so to speak. He turned towards the sea.

On a rock surrounded by water, several feet away from the shore, sat a woman. She was naked, her auburn hair falling gracefully over her pale body. She was wearing a pearl necklace and had a matching pearl broche in her hair. When Hob met her eyes, she curled one finger in coquettish invitation.

Hob realized he had taken a step forwards when he heard a splash and felt the cold of the water through his leather boots. _Don't be so dense, Gadling,_ he reprimanded himself. _If you searched for the definition of "siren" in a dictionary, she'd be pictured next to it._

He could not hear her, but he saw her laugh before waving off her own invitation. _So cliché!_ she mouthed. She was most likely a dream, the dream of a sailor, and she had just wanted to have a quick laugh with the funny little man she had spotted on the shore. Continuing with their strange game of charades, she mouthed, _I'll do better!_ and did an exaggerated thinking gesture, eyes turned to the sky and index finger tapping her chin.

Hob was certain that he knew the man on the rock (for it was a man now). He was large and muscular, with skin toasted by a job outside. A job like plowing the fields day in and day out, fields near to Hob's own, that he would walk by on his way to town and they'd greet each other, then meet each other again in a tavern, where they would drink and laugh and keep drinking until the memory of being pressed against a wall in a dark corner with a hand down his breeches was so eroded that he could only guess it had been this man and not another.

This time, he caught his step halfway through and instead took a step back. He was starting to dislike this game, and wasn't there something else he should be doing? Why had he come to this beach? Wasn't he headed somewhere different?

She was back to what he thought to be her original form and pouting. _Too long ago?_ She rolled her eyes with her whole head so that Hob could spot it from where he stood. _I don't want to do it the easy way._ When she mouthed "easy", she swept a hand over her hair with a flourish, and it was suddenly black instead of auburn. She made a pantomime of reaching into the water and pulling something out, except she _was_ pulling something out, a black fabric that she then held in front of her body. She covered up to her nose with it, and it was right in the frontier between see-through and opaque so Hob could guess at the pale silhouette behind it but nothing more detailed than that. She shimmied her shoulders, and the fabric shimmied with her. The word "burlesque" popped up in Hob's brain.

She wiggled her eyebrows and her eyes turned from green to dark blue. She was too far away from the shore for something like that to be noticed from there, but Hob was now far from the shore, too. Maybe he should stop walking. Why? He didn't know. Maybe he should keep walking.

Her hair was getting shorter, and it was losing it's glamorous luster. It was messier now, starting to stand up in random angles. His face—the face of the man on the rock, he was a man again—was getting sharper, too, less alluring siren, more alluring vampire. A Lord that would woo you with prideful scowls and hidden smiles.

Bile rose up Hob's throat. Fuck, what in fucking hell? He stopped walking abruptly, but even as he did so he knew, deep in his gut: Too late.

There were claws grabbing him by the cheeks now, or long fingernails, or talons, he didn't know. The world was getting fuzzier around the edges. The creature's eyes were in front of him, and they weren't green or blue, but golden. He felt his legs give in, but the hand clutching his face kept him from falling.

"Oh, Dream," he heard a voice croon just before everything went dark. "You know I _always_ go for the heart."

## Chapter 9

Dream was everywhere. In the battlefield, fighting. In his palace, talking strategy with Lucienne. Visiting dreams, making sure everything kept running smoothly despite the war. He was used to this sort of omnipresence. Enjoyed it, even, because it was a reminder that he was no longer in a cruel cage within a binding circle. It was natural to him to have his essence spread around the Dreaming.

The first night Hob had shown up in his palace, he had suddenly been _just there_. Hob Gadling had wandered into his throne room (just like Rose Walker had recently done, too), and Dream was both angry and terrified. He knew it was too soon for another vortex, and he also knew that Hob was there because Dream's heart of hearts had been reaching out to him every single night since he last saw him in the Waking World. But Denial is such a wonderful thing that maybe it should be the eighth Endless. So Dream tried to stomp and yell and sneer his problems (his beloved) away. His want of protection, of having Hob vanish the Morningstar's armies for him like he had once done with Constantine's hired goons, it was as selfish as it was foolish. This was not a pair of human men with knives, but a hoard of beings from the darkest corners of Hell. If he could only reason with Hob...

But he could not reason with anyone when Hob was holding him like that and swearing oaths of love and loyalty to him. Hob didn't want to fight for the sake of fighting; Hob wanted to protect Dream, to kill for Dream. If this had happened at any previous moment in their relationship, Dream would've surely reacted similarly to how he had in 1889. This bag of meat and muscles and sinew, who may not die but can still bleed, protecting _him_, the concept of dreams personified? But this was not 1889 nor any time before that, and not only was Dream beginning to learn to keep his pride from destroying his relationships, he also craved safety like had never craved it before. (If Hob had been there, Roderick Burgess's death wouldn't have been an accident; Hob would have slammed his head against the glass himself. He would've shot Alexander Burgess with the same shotgun that had killed Jessamy.)

Maybe there was a part of him that knew himself to be making a mistake when he fulfilled Hob's wish, but when a newly-knighted Hob smiled at him, all doubts evaporated. This could be a good, nay, a _wonderful_ thing.

Hob was ruthless in battle, but he was also reckless. Wherever he went, whether on foot or on the horse Dream had gifted him (and Dream was still deciding if he liked the name Hob had given her), demons fell by the dozen, but not without injuring Hob as well. All Dream wanted was to have Hob with him in his realm at all times, but he knew he had to limit Hob's time in the Dreaming or else he would drive himself mad in battle. Clearly, Hob was not willing to give himself the rest his mind needed, so Dream had to intercede.

Despite his extended consciousness, Dream forced himself not to constantly observe Hob when he was in the Dreaming. It had actually been more of a decision taken with his council. With a particular member of his council. With Matthew, when he told him he was being "fucken creepy, boss". When Hob had ridden away after his quip that Dream had found, despite the man's immortality, in poor taste, Dream let him slip away from his awareness, partially to stop being "fucken creepy, boss", and partially to be petty. If Hob wanted to continue to throw himself headfirst into danger without rhyme or reason, so be it, but Dream wasn't going to bear witness to such idiocy.

He should've been watching. He should've known something was wrong. He should've realized something was amiss before spotting Night Mare galloping around the battlefield, riderless.

All of a sudden, his essence was in a single place again: standing in front of the horse, holding her reins and soothingly rubbing her neck. "**It's all right, She Who Brings The Twilight.**" (For this was the name Dream had given her when he had created her.) "**Just tell me what happened. Where is he?**" The mare continued to paw the ground, offering no response. "**Night Mare. Answer me.**"

Night Mare lowered her head. "I'm so sorry, my Lord," she replied. "I don't know what came over me. We rode towards the beaches on the far end of Your realm. There was a presence; it distracted him and terrified me. I ran away, I don't think he noticed, and when I came back he was gone." She was trembling now. "You trusted me with his safety and I failed You, Your Majesty. I am sorry."

He wanted to unmake her. What is the point creating a dream specifically to guard a dreamer if she could not do that single task?! Dream's hand tightened on her reins, and she groveled even more. A thought stopped him, **_Hob would be very upset._** He pried his hand away from the reins and tensely ordered, "**Stay out of the battlefield until I call upon you again.**"

With one last bow, she vanished in a cloud of sand. Dream did the same, and reappeared in his throne room.

Lucienne was waiting for him where he had left her in the middle of a sentence when his consciousness had folded itself into a single point in the Dreaming. He did not let her say the second half of that sentence. "**Where is Gault?**" He may have phrased it as a question, but it was a command that summoned the dream to the throne room immediately.

"Sir—" Both Lucienne and Gault spoke at the same time, and surely both of them were intending to offer some commentary about Dream's agitated state.

Dream interrupted them, "**Gather as many dreams and nightmares as you see fit for a search party. Do what you must to find him.**" He was pacing, he didn't know when he had started pacing, but when Gault opened her mouth to reply (probably to argue, there was no need for a reply, she should already be gone), he stopped dead in his tracks and turned to her. "**FIND HIM!**" His voice invoked the terror of a fevered man unable to awake from a nightmare.

Gault nodded a bow and flew away. Dream resumed his pacing.

"**I cannot find him, I cannot feel him. I did not sense him leaving the Dreaming, and yet he is _gone_.**" He pressed his palms to his eyes and let out a sound between a scream and a growl. "**I did this, I did this, I—**" His hands fell away and his eyes snapped open. "**Desire.**"

"You don't know that." Lucienne's voice, cold and direct, cut through the surge of rage pounding in his head.

He turned to her with a snarl. "**I don't know that? Who else would _dare_. Not even the Morningstar themself. My sibling will pay for this with their _head_.**"

Why did he keep around a librarian as counselor if she didn't have the decency to even flinch when faced with the King of Nightmares' anger? "That is exactly what you can't do, my Lord. You have not gathered enough proof of their involvement in this war, let alone Hob Gadling's—" Here she did swallow and bow her head. "Disappearance," she finished, almost a whisper.

Dream could feel himself unfolding again, becoming jagged shadows and grasping claws and bloodied teeth. "**I. Don't. _Care_,**" a shadow bellowed and a claw hissed and a tooth snapped. "**I will go to Desire and tear them apart until they tell me—**"

It started as it always did, with the slightest of pulls to the core of his being. A call to attention. Lucienne was watching him with curiosity. She did not understand why he had stopped talking or why his form had suddenly regained its more solid shape. She did not feel it. She did not hear the voice that rang around every inch of the Dreaming.

"Attend, brother dearest. I stand in my gallery and hold your sigil. I think it's time for some negotiations, don't you think?"

## Chapter 10

Dream stormed into The Threshold ready to tear Desire apart, and his determination grew when he was faced with the scene in Desire's gallery.

His sibling was lounging on their crimson chair. They were wearing a long, red skirt cut on the side up to their upper thigh revealing the fishnet stockings underneath, and a long-sleeved blouse of the same color, loosely tied over their sternum with a flimsy bow. Their attire should've been of no concern to Dream, but there was something infuriating about seeing them dressed so casually while causing such devastation in Dream's realm.

Regardless of that, Dream did not pay more than half a second of his attention to their display of nonchalance, center stage and illuminated to draw all eyes in. What was truly important was off to the side, in the shadows created by the cavernous structures of Desire's palace. He was clearly unconscious, but his head was held aloft by the snaking black straps that gagged him and curled around his neck to securely fasten his arms across his torso, all of it pulled taut to keep him upright in his kneeling position. No one, not even Dream in his unending pride, should ever make Hob Gadling kneel. He was wearing not his armor but his sleeping clothes (soft pants and a cotton shirt), leaving him horribly vulnerable.

"Dream, Dream, Dream, _so_ nice of you to join us—"

Desire was wearing a red ribbon snug against their neck as a necklace. This is what Dream used to lift them out of their seat and up into the air. "**Every time I think you have gone too far, you find a new way to be an insolent fool. You launch an attack against my realm, and then you take him from me. You think you will not pay dearly for it all?**"

Desire had the gall to look entertained, and Dream considered throwing them across the room. "Now, now, big brother. _Allegedly_ launched an attack against your realm. And—" Their eyes flitted over to Hob before gazing down at Dream again. "Well, I can't really claim I don't have your boytoy, now can I?" They threw their head back and laughed, the way Dream's hand started shaking against their throat probably strengthening their good humour. "Robbie, baby, look who's here!"

When Desire snapped their fingers, Hob's eyes flew open. He looked around in panic, a hoarse scream muffled by the gag, and when he spotted Dream, his panic intensified. Without a second thought, Dream unceremoniously dropped Desire back into their chair. Forget Desire, forget the Morningstar. All that mattered was getting Hob to safety. He took a step towards Hob.

"Wait." He didn't obey the command. He wasn't one to obey anything or anyone, definitely not his traitorous sibling. But he did wait, or to be more precise, he hesitated because there was none of the usual playfulness in Desire's voice. An arm snaked around his torso to hold him in place and a chin rested on his shoulder. "I did say we were going to negotiate, little Dream," Desire whispered next to his ear. "He can be yours again, for a price." His bindings were too tight to allow any movement, but Dream was sure Hob was trying to shake his head.

"**What makes you think that you have any claim—?**"

"You are a guest here in my realm, dearest. You can't waltz in and grab my new decoration, that's quite rude."

Precisely. That is how the Endless were bound to behave in each other's realms, which was why Dream's every thought since the invasion began had been haunted by questions of Desire's involvement. "**And yet you came to mine and did as you pleased,**" he growled.

Desire slid off him just so he could see the feigned confusion on their face. "Remind me again, when was the last time I was in the Dreaming?" They placed a finger on Dream's lips before he could answer. "That you have proof of, of course." They waved a hand at Hob. "What matters is that he is here now, under my possession. And I have a very generous deal I want to strike with you for him. Get 'im while he's _hot_."

Inquiring about the deal equaled, in Dream's mind, to begging. "**He is not here physically. His body remains in the Waking World.**" He had checked a millisecond before accepting Desire's invitation. He had looked so peaceful and unbothered.

Desire raised their eyebrows. "Oh, Dream! You dog!" they tittered. Dream was getting sick of how everything he did or said only amused his sibling even further. "If all you want is his body, then we are done here, go have fun!"

Anger and shame colored Dream's cheeks. He looked at Hob, hoping to convey without having to say it in front of Desire that his words had been unfairly twisted. No, that was not enough. His pride, his stupid pride again. "**That is not what I meant, you know that.**"

"I know, I know," Desire replied even though the statement had not been directed at them. They tapped Dream on the nose, and Dream wanted to rip the appendage out of its socket with his teeth. "I'm just having some fun, you know me."

"**The deal, Desire,**" Dream hissed, growing tired of their games. "**What do you offer?**"

"Oh, it is a marvelous offer, just you wait. Here are your options: Option A," they clapped their hands once and a spotlight illuminated Hob. The man blinked under the sudden change in lighting. "You take this scrumptious specimen home _and_ Luci's assault on the Dreaming ends. A two-in-one deal, you cannot say I'm not generous. In return—"

"**How while you force the Morningstar—?**"

"_In return_," Desire insisted, "you and your Dreaming will become subservient to Despair and to me. You will still be King, you will rule... _mostly_ as you please, but you will answer to _us_."

The shadows on the edges of the gallery flickered and twisted in response to Dream's silent fury. "**To _you_, you mean, my sibling, for you never think of anyone but yourself, not even your twin.**"

Desire ignored him. "Option B: I keep my new toy and Hell decimates your realm. Despair and I will figure out if we have any use for whatever ruins remain."

There was silence. Desire was staring at him with pure malice, but he would not give them the satisfaction of meeting their eyes. Instead, he turned to Hob. Again, despite his bindings, the minute movement of his head was clear: a nod. He was silently giving Dream permission for something, and Dream knew exactly for what because this was Hob, the man that the centuries had molded into a kind and selfless soul: _Leave me behind_. Desire's second option was half empty threats. If Dream refused their offer, he could still go back and win the war, crushing Hell under his... what had Hob called them? Doc Martens? All he had to do was leave Hob behind.

"**No,**" he answered Hob, although Desire once again probably thought he was talking to them. "**My pride has hurt you once before. I will not repeat that mistake.**" Hob's eyes grew wide again, and he strained against his bindings as he tried to speak through the gag.

The malice in Desire's expression had grown exponentially, accompanied now by the tiniest speck of surprise. "Option A, then, I presume?"

Dream knew himself to have rows upon rows of needle-sharp teeth when he smiled at his sibling. "**Option C. You release Hob. The Dreaming remains independent from your influence,**" Desire frowned and opened their mouth, but Dream wasn't done yet, "**_but_ I step down from my throne.**"

This time, Hob's "No!" was loud enough to be heard despite him being gagged. Neither Endless paid him any mind.

"**If the Morningstar wishes to continue their assault, I know my creations to be more than capable of stopping them.**"

Desire's frown grew deeper. "I am failing to see what I gain from that."

"**What _you_ desire, my sibling.**" Dream's face was now inches away from Desire's. "**My humiliation. It may not satisfy the Lightbringer's thirst of conquest, but that does not interest you. You only want to see me humiliated.**"

When Desire smiled, the bowels that Dream did not need shrivelled, but he knew that he had won, if one could call this a victory. "And you'd really do that?"

"**For his safety and the safety of the Dreaming? Yes.**" Dream then added in his head, **_Anything_**, but it was better to keep that from Desire, lest they grow greedy. Greedier, that is. "**Allow me one final communication with my council and you'll have your prize.**"

Desire rolled their eyes. "You can write them a bye-bye letter from your retirement home." They snapped their fingers, the bindings disappeared, and Hob, unconscious once again, fell to the floor. "And don't forget your peasant on the way out." They sat down again and began inspecting their nails. "I swear, _musk_ is one thing, but that one? Don't you wash your things, Dream?"

Dream was no longer listening. He crouched down next to Hob and gently cradled him in his arms. His cloak grew around them, and with one final glacial stare at his sibling, they left the Threshold.

## Chapter 11

Hob's peaceful awakening lasted him a ridiculously short time. As his neurons reconnected and the memories flooded back, the old habit of "it was just a dream" tried its best to fix the impending crisis with a good dose of denial. It accomplished nothing. He threw his sheets aside with a resounding "Fuck!", ready to go somewhere but with no idea where. Maybe if he downed five mugs worth of chamomile tea to calm his nerves, he'd be able to fall asleep again and enter the Dreaming, but could he get there fast enough before Dream delivered his **_one final communication_**? Where would Dream go now? Was he really planning to step down? Why the fuck didn't that stupid man-shaped _idiot_ have a fucking mobile?!

Hob was standing next to his bed, ready to take on the Universe in a fistfight in his bloody pajamas and shaking like a Chihuahua on a massage chair.

And he was being watched.

Dream was sitting on the foot of his bed, the edges of him blending with the shadows behind him. His eyes were gleaming. Hob had started to get used to the stars that shone from within them in the Dreaming, so it took him a moment to realize that there were no stars, only tears reflecting the early rays of sunlight peeking in through the curtains. The rest of his expression was stony. He looked rather out of it.

It was a very strange experience to feel a friend become solid in your arms. When Hob closed the space between them and hugged Dream, there was a moment when he swore his arms were going right through him, but then he was holding something. It wasn't a body, but it was _something_. It made the hairs on his arms stand up. Slowly, it began feeling more and more like actual mass, until it felt like he was hugging another person. He wasn't, but how could that bother him? He was hugging his best friend.

Apart from his solidification, Dream didn't react to the hug. Because of the awkward angle with Hob standing and Dream still sitting, Dream's face ended up pressed against Hob's chest. Not in a way that suggested he wanted it there, but in one that suggested he had not realized Hob was there. "**Did I really just do that?**" His voice was muffled by Hob's shirt, and Hob tried to ignore how the sound tickled his skin through the thin fabric.

Hob moved back to look at Dream's face, and yes, his instincts had been right, the tears were starting to spill. "You're asking _me_, love?" The awkward angle remained, Dream titling his head back to look up at Hob, and Hob was, for some bleeding reason, cradling his head between his hands. It all seemed to be staged to perfection so all Hob had to do was bend down and—No. Focus. "I did not understand half of what happened, and I was unconscious for the other half. I know shit-all. As usual." He gave Dream a lopsided grin that he hoped disguised the fact he was lying through his teeth. He had understood enough, and there was a part of him that wanted to yell at Dream until his voice was hoarse about how monumentally stupid he had been. **_My pride has hurt you once before. I will not repeat that mistake._** Yeah, that was really sweet and all, but not wanting to ever leave Hob brokenhearted in the rain again was one thing. Giving up your goddamn throne was a whole other fucking thing, you dense bastard!

Yelling was not going to accomplish anything. He would eventually mention it to Dream, but not right now, not when he was crying and barely hanging on to his physical form. Instead, Hob rubbed circles with his thumbs into the sides of Dream's jaw. "If I may ask," he began gently, "how is this going to work? I thought you _were_ the Dreaming." _And you don't appear mortal to me,_ he didn't comment, because that thought had flashed through his mind: a fallen angel, a divine king turned mortal commoner. Hob would've loved him all the same, but... he would've been mortal. And Hob wasn't. It was, in a strange way, a relief to see him still be so unnervingly supernatural.

Dream closed his eyes, which proved that at least the massage was doing something. "**It's symbolic,**" he explained in a murmur. "**I cannot disconnect myself from the Dreaming, not completely, at least, but by swearing an oath so binding, I cannot command it anymore. I am now similar to a power generator like the ones you humans use for your electronic devices; I cannot command my creations just like it cannot command the electrons that flow out of it.**" Hob had once tried to learn something about electromagnetism. It had not gone well. He was just going to accept the word of an otherworldly being who had been MIA for most of the past century and not question the simile. He wanted to make a joke about it, but then he felt Dream start to tremble between his hands. Dream spoke again, voice breaking, "**I can still feel them, each and every one of them, fighting _my_ war.**"

Hob hugged him again, and this time, Dream did consciously bury his face into Hob's chest. "Hey, hey, hey. We'll figure something out, I promise. It's going to be okay." He rubbed Dream's back. "Have you contacted Lucienne yet?"

"**I sent her a letter explaining what had happened and, as my final instruction as her king, appointing her the head of my army. I am certain she will perform admirably.**" He buried himself deeper into Hob's chest. "**Better than I ever could.**" Hob pretended not to hear that last part because this was Dream, vanity incarnate from the tip of his messy hair to the tip of his goth boots, and self-deprecation was not something he did.

"Just a letter? I think she should hear it in person." It wasn't Hob's intention to make Dream feel bad (or worse, in this case), but he had been dumped over mail a few times and over text another few, and it was never a fun experience.

"**It was part of my sibling's terms and therefore part of the oath I swore.**"

Desire had treated it all with levity, but Dream spoke of it like there had been a Bible involved. "I mean, I didn't hear you say "I swear" or anything, I'm sure you can find some wiggle room," Hob said, trying to keep his tone light because he was sure this went beyond his puny human comprehension.

The only wiggle room Dream seemed willing to find was between Hob's arms and body to separate his face from his chest and look up at him with a raised eyebrow. "**Hob Gadling, are you trying to convince me to go back on my word?**"

"I'm just saying it wasn't an oath."

"**The Hecatae would not agree with you.**"

"Tell them to come talk to me over a pint, I can be very persuasive." And there, the slightest hint of mirth in Dream's eyes. "I told you, we'll figure something out."

"**I thought those to be empty words of comfort, offered without true intention or meaning.**"

If Dream wanted to cling to the joy he had found in the form of banter, then Hob would give him banter. The time for seriousness and planning would come later. "You wound me, duck, oh so deeply. I would not dare to speak banalities in your presence."

"**You would return your King to his rightful throne?**"

"Aye. But not before breakfast or a shower, though." He slowly released Dream from his embrace, and he knew he wasn't imagining it when Dream's hand clung momentarily to his bicep. "I'm not going far," he reassured him. "Make yourself at home, alright? Be right with you." In a surge of bravery, he placed a quick kiss to the top of Dream's head before heading towards the bathroom.

It's not that he wanted to believe the bullshit that came out of Desire's mouth, but they had had a point with that last comment; with his head so wrapped up in the war, Hob may have not been keeping up with his self-care as much as he usually did. He wasn't going to do much today, either, not with Dream waiting for him, but he did want to be a bit more presentable than pajamas he hadn't washed in a while and morning breath. After a quick shower, he grabbed his phone as he toweled his hair dry and (struggling slightly to make the stupid touch screen respond to his wet fingers) made a call.

His mind was only barely on what he was doing or saying into the phone; it was mostly on Dream. "Hullo? Yeah, I'm not going to make it today. Or in the next few days. Dunno how many." Would he like scrambled eggs? French toast? Hob was definitely going to make him some tea, the fancy stuff, good for the nerves. Good for everything, when you're British. "Family emergency." He almost grabbed a red T-shirt, then remembered he was currently very cross with that particular color (and with curving walls of that color and with anthropomorphic personifications that wore that color) and went for a dark green v-neck instead. "Stu can sub for me, right? I'll send him my PowerPoints." He'd put him back into his fancy black throne on those ridiculous stairs if it's the last thing he did, which it wouldn't be because he was still set on sticking around until the heat death of the universe, and he'd have Dream back in the Dreaming before Christmas break or so help him God. "So he'll give them more time for the essays! Jesus, can't your deadlines piss off for a second?" Something about how he was now going around hugging and being hugged by his Stranger made him double-check his reflection in the mirror before he cursed himself. This was not the time for his vanity. "Yeah, I really need to go now, I'm sure you'll figure something out."

He told himself not to immediately panic when he returned to the bedroom and Dream wasn't there. His instincts were proven right once more when he heard faint rustling coming from the living room. Dream was inspecting one of Hob's many shelves containing all sort of knickknacks from across the centuries. Even with all he had on display, he still had even more in storage. He liked to switch them around every now and then, give them all their time in the spotlight, so there was no sort of order in what was displayed. For example, Dream was currently giving a gentle tap to a John Lennon bobblehead that stood between a puzzle snuffbox Hob had won in a game of cards in 1731 and an IBM Simon.

Dream turned to look at him when he stepped out of the bedroom. He had regained his usual aloof composure, full control over his form, head held high, and no trace of tears. When he offered Hob a smile, it was tiny and somewhat condescending. "**You've got quite a collection.**"

"Thank you, old friend. Breakfast?" Before Dream could say something about not requiring mortal sustenance, Hob amended. "Sorry, did that come out like a question? I meant to say," He pointed a stern finger at Dream, "breakfast." As he put the kettle on and started putting together a simple breakfast of avocado on toast (he had decided to let the tea be the star of the morning, his anxiety was messing with his appetite), he heard "**Insufferable man**", and he knew he was being thanked for his hospitality and his help.

It was a task and a half to convince a being who gave the phrase "divine right of kings" a whole new meaning that one could eat without cutlery while sitting on a couch. Dream only nibbled a corner of his toast before setting the plate down on the coffee table with no intention of ever picking it up again, but at least the tea seemed to be working its magic. Once both of their empty mugs were set down, Hob asked, "Feel better?"

Whatever walls Dream had put back up while Hob had been in the bathroom cracked slightly. "**How can I? When my creations suffer and I cannot help them?**"

"The first step in figuring out how to help them is for you to stop kicking yourself every two seconds." Hob patted Dream's knee, and that was all he had been planning on doing, but then Dream scooted closer to him, their shoulders touching now, and Hob was suddenly incapable of separating his hand from his leg, now a tad more on the thigh than on the knee. He considered bringing up the subject of oath wiggle room again, start talking strategy.

And then the woman appeared in his living room.

## Chapter 12

Of course she knew Hob Gadling. _He_ didn't know _her_, not officially, but that was just part of their whole deal, wasn't it? Well, no, because if she had ever decided to pop by for a chat and a cuppa, it wouldn't have been the same as stopping by to offer her gift, which was what their deal prevented. Given him a proper scare, it would've, obviously. And she would've felt pressured to answer the thousand of questions that dear little Dream always dodged, and that wasn't her place. Better not to drop by.

But she did know him.

How could she not? He was exempt from her gift, but he was so full of love and passion and curiosity, he never gave up on surrounding himself with others that did not share that particularity. And so, several times across the centuries, he had been somewhere nearby as she collected a soul. Or several souls. And she remembers all of them.

Before she even started the gamble with Dream and Hob (the latter as an unsuspecting but enthusiastic participant), the Black Death had already taken both his parents, and war had taken a handful of his friends. She was there, she remembers the souls, he was there, but at the time, he was... she would _never_ call any human "a nobody". He was a friend she hadn't met yet. Still hasn't met. Will meet someday.

After the gamble was struck, there were other wars and other illnesses that took other people. When she showed up, she saw realization evolving in his face. It started as relief at his "dumb luck", they had both been skewered by the same bastard's sword, but apparently it had missed all the important bits in him because he was still breathing. It slowly morphed into disbelief, because surely he had _stopped_ breathing at one point there, it wasn't the fever talking, the treatment had done shit, his lungs had stopped responding. It eventually landed on a mix of elation and terror, the first due to him being a talkative drunk, not a lying drunk, he had meant what he had said that fateful evening. The second because there were still some years to go before 1489, when he would have a chance to ask what kind of deal exactly he had gotten himself into (and he wouldn't get a full answer until many, many, _many_ years later, and really, little brother, was it necessary to leave the poor bloke fumbling all for the sake of your mysterious persona?).

And thus began a period of cockiness. He was sure he wasn't dying anytime soon, he at least knew The Stranger wasn't a devil, and he had found a non-soldiering profession that decreased the amount of horrors he witnessed. She still saw him every now and then, though. Even when he had the money to throw as an attempt to erase her from the edges of his vision.

Just like she remembers all of them, she remembers cradling the baby against her chest with one hand as she helped Eleanor out of bed with the other. Led on by the midwife garb she was wearing at the time, Eleanor had asked her if it was safe to stand "so soon". Led on by the sad look she received as a response, Eleanor turned around to look at the man hunched over in his chair by her bed, by her _body_, his shoulders shaking with his sobs. A finely dressed gentleman, yet his sobs sounded exactly the same as they had had when he was a scrawny peasant boy clinging to his mother as they dragged the body away to the mass grave.

"Oh, Robert. We'll see each other soon enough in the Lord's Kingdom. Won't we?"

Eleanor had looked at her for that last part. Maybe Dream was onto something when he avoided answering questions.

Hob hadn't been there when she came for Robyn, but she saw him in the way the lad's eyes shone with mischief. She bent over to help him up from the floor (not unlike how she had helped his mother out of bed), his hands a bit too grabby with adrenaline and alcohol.

"I am not done with him, 'tis certain," he laughed, but the other man was already being pushed out the door by his friends, a horrified look on his face. And on the floor, a young man with glassy eyes that were staring, but not looking, at his own soul above him, blood pooling around his head where the edge of the table had hit.

She knew that if anyone were to ask Hob, he'd say that from there til at least two centuries later, he hadn't been anywhere close to where Death went about her rounds; he'd learnt a horrid lesson about immortality and love, and had begun to hold the mortal world at arm's length. It would've been a filthy lie.

She saw him staring blankly at the floor as she collected the soul of an old man wrecked by the London cold, still clutching the stale bread Hob had shared with him. She saw him cursing up a storm at the drunk who had shoved the young prostitute over a ledge into the Thames. She saw him and heard the last bit of the story he was telling the boy that fell asleep on his shoulder, never to wake up again. She dreaded the coming of Hob's and her brother's next meeting, thinking that he'd finally ask for her gift. It would've broken her heart. (And Dream's heart, as well, even if he loved pretending he didn't have one.)

It was quite a turn he took when he managed to reinvent himself. She started seeing him less and less, and yet there were those times when she'd collect a soul while in the stuffed belly of a ship and learn, from what a sailor was saying or a captain was writing, the name of the British gentleman that had invested good coin in that ship's travels. She remembers all of those souls. She remembers every time Hob's name was tied to the deed. She knows Hob remembers, too.

One day, those appointments stopped short (the ones tied to Hob, that is, of course. The rest... oh, the rest...). She silently thanked whoever or whatever had finally knocked some sense into his head and some life back into the good heart she knows he carries within. Still, she held on to her anger years after that. This human that she considered a friend in a bizarre one-sided relationship had disappointed her deeply, and even if he was unaware of her anger (and her existence), she'd not grant forgiveness so easily. Either way, the times that followed did not offer many occasions for her to see him.

And then came the horrors of the modern world.

When war broke out across Europe, it was only natural that Hob Gadling would end up in its midst. He had the experience and no reason to use any of the tricks or guiles he'd picked up over the centuries to avoid the draft. It all sounded righteous enough, too, and that's not an honor all of the wars he'd fought in could be awarded. The righteousness of it all evaporated soon enough. The hunger. The chemical weapons. The civilians caught in the crossfire. She began doing something she had never done before: distracting the souls and making sure they did not look back at their bodies. That used to be their choice, whether they wanted to look back or not. Now, she saw to it that they didn't even consider the option. More than once, she left behind one Hob Gadling staring at the burnt corpse.

That was The Great War. The War to End All Wars. There was hope there, in the name. She cannot judge humans for something as beautiful as their hope.

For the life of her (with apologies for the paradoxical choice of words), she couldn't understand what had driven him to join the _Second_ World War. (They were numbering them, now. Hope dwindled sometimes in the face of horrors.) Once again, there were good reasons being used to call the British men to take up arms, but with everything that Hob had lived through already, surely he'd find a way to slip between the fingers of the draft and escape a new wave of man-made nightmares (and those are far worse than yours, little brother). He didn't. He was there, she saw him. Over and over and over and over and over and over again. And war kept getting crueler. It felt stupid to say so, water kept getting wetter, but when your job is to reap what's left behind, you need to say it.

Hob was both a friend and a stranger. He was a human who had no business in the business of the Endless, and yet he was so close to it that calling upon him would've equaled interfering in Dream's affairs. And that is exactly what she was unable to do, bound by ancient laws. She could not interfere, neither in requesting Hob's assistance nor in grabbing a crowbar with her own hands and smashing that cursed _fishbowl_ to pieces, not if Dream didn't explicitly request it. And he didn't. Of course he didn't.

She knew Hob so painfully, so closely, that she forgot that _he_ didn't know _her_, and that's why the first time he met her, formally, was when she appeared in his living room, the second sermon of the decade for her little brother already starting to pour out of her mouth before she'd fully taken form.

## Chapter 13

"Of all the stupid things you've ever done, I swear, this one— you really went all out with this one, didn't you?! Drove straight into StupidTown, no stops! You didn't think, you didn't think, you didn't _think_!"

Hob's brain was unsure of the order of events. The woman was yelling. There was a sound of feathers rustling. There was a woman in his living room. This had all happened simultaneously. Or not. It had been a sequence of events. The order of events was a mystery. There was a woman in his living room, and she was yelling at Dream, gesturing wildly with her arms as she did so. Also... a invisible large bird or some other winged being was involved in all of this somehow?

Hob decided he should give up on what he wasn't good at (thinking) and instead focus on what he excelled at (protecting Dream). His hand tightened on Dream's thigh, and he was ready to physically cover him with his body if the need arose, even though he knew Dream would prefer to fight this battle himself. Except Dream's expression wasn't one of cold fury (the one Hob remembered _very_ clearly), but one of resignation and... embarrassment? That was a new one.

"You— You—" the woman sputtered before throwing her hands in the air. "I can't. I give up. This is too much. _You're_ too much."

Taking advantage of the woman's despaired pause, Dream offered Hob a sheepish smile (another novelty!). "**My older sister,**" he explained.

In Hob's defense, his brain had been turned to mush, and apparently, the first brain cells to return to their senses were permanently stuck in the Regency era. He practically jumped to the other end of the couch. Here was Dream's older sister, catching them alone in Hob's private quarters with Hob's hand on her brother's thigh and not even an engagement to be wed to show in their defense. His next thought was, _Wait, twenty-first century._ The next after that scrambled to mock his use of _private quarters_ to describe his small flat, the mockery a desperate attempt to cover up thoughts of engagements. Finally, somewhere around the fourth or fifth thought, what was truly noteworthy about the situation hit him. "Older sister? You mean..." He swallowed thickly.

The woman's annoyance evaporated and she offered Hob an apologetic smile. "Oh, Hob, I'm so sorry to have barged in like this. It's just..." She gestured at Dream in lieu of an verbal explanation (and her meaning was crystal clear). "But that's not your fault, and we haven't even been properly introduced." And she extended a hand and said the words Hob knew were coming but still hit him like a slap to the face. "I'm Death, Dream's sister."

Hob took in her kind smile, her soft eyes, and the pendant hanging from her neck—an ankh, the Egyptian symbol for life. "But you're so—" He bit his tongue before he could end that sentence in any way he would regret. _Human_ or _nice_ would most likely offend her. _Normal_ would offend both her and Dream. She was probably already offended because he had not taken the hand she had offered.

"Not stupid?" she offered with a pointed glare at Dream, who glowered.

"I wasn't going to say that!" Hob squeaked. He looked at Dream with his hands up in surrender. "I was not going to say that."

Dream didn't appear to believe him, but he didn't comment on it. Instead, he replied to the fear that Hob was embarrassed to say he had. "**You can take her hand, Hob. It won't kill you.**"

"Right, sorry," he mumbled, then tried for a charming smile as he shook her hand (it was warm in the most mundane of ways). "Robert Gadling, at your service, my Lady."

Her smile widened. "I know. Thank you for taking him in. I know he can be a lot sometimes."

"It's my pleasure." Hob felt a hot flush rise to his cheeks. "Just trying to be a good friend, I mean, or a decent one, at least."

There was a knowing look on Death's face, and it only made Hob squirm further into his seat. "You are an excellent friend, Hob. I wish we'd met sooner, but this one," she made a disappointed face at Dream, "never told you jack-shit about himself, let alone his family."

And then she flicked Dream of the Endless on the forehead.

And Dream of the Endless muttered, "**Ow.**"

"I thought that was an ancient-law-forbids-it type of thing," Hob said, fighting back a fond smile at the domestic scene of two siblings squabbling.

"No, that was a Dream type of thing," Death sighed and shook her head. "Like acting without thinking."

While it was nice to have someone to scold Dream when Hob was too scared to do so, he felt it necessary to dot some i's, as it were. "It wasn't his fault, you know. Desire left him no choice."

Death and Dream looked at each other. Hob barely remembered what it was like to have a sibling, but he knew a mental conversation when he saw one. And, hey, considering who these two were, it could be an actual telepathic conversation. If that were the case, Hob would feel a bit awkward and frankly left out, but thankfully, Dream spoke up soon enough.

"**That was just the climax of the story,**" he explained, and Hob almost argued that he wasn't very fond of his kidnapping being referred to as **_a story_**. "**I made a mistake since the moment I allowed you to fight.**"

Dream saying he made a mistake. A rare and precious moment. Hob was somewhat sorry that he was about to take that moment away from him. "Still not your fault. I can be very annoying once I set my mind onto something."

Death's knowing look returned when Dream smiled at Hob. "**That is true, my friend, but it does not excuse my mistake.**"

Wasn't he already going through enough? Did he have to be so harsh on himself on top of it all? "Agree to disagree, alright? But the past's in the past, let's talk future. My Lady, I, uh, I—" He cleared his throat even though it was unlikely that it would vanish his stutter. "Will you help us figure out how to fix this?"

Again, Dream's and Death's eyes met like they were having their own side conversation. Hob might've known this woman for about a second, but he still noted the change in the usual roles when her face remained serious and Dream's lips twisted into a smirk. "**He did just say he can be very annoying.**"

Death cracked a smile, but it wasn't as wide as the others had been. "You really are an amazing friend, Hob, but it's not that easy." She sat down on the arm of the horrid armchair Hob had bought when online shopping was at its infancy (and getting ripped off and delivered a piece of rubbish was the norm). "My brother has made a formal commitment. Destiny is going to have his ass as it is. If he backs down..." She shook her head.

Hob was about to go right back into his spiel about whether the actual words "I swear" had been said when Dream, surprisingly, was the one to retort. "**There could be...**" He paused and looked at Hob before letting out a longsuffering sigh. "**..._wiggle room_,**" he finished as if saying such a pedestrian phrase could kill him on the spot.

"Wiggle room?" Death repeated.

"**My oath was made under duress created by Desire with very suspicious methods. Even if they did not enter my realm, Hob was still taken from the Dreaming to the Threshold. Furthermore, they insinuated having a certain control over the Lightbringer and the invasion of my realm.**"

Hob might've been trying to piece together the ancient laws that no one had the decency to explain to him, now with the added fact of Destiny being discussed like a person, but he was still going to stubbornly step blindly into the unknown if it meant helping Dream. "If it helps..." he began, waiting to be stopped for interrupting a discussion of cosmic proportions. "When I was taken, the... the... whatever took me. Had golden eyes. And... you know. That feels significant."

Dream's expression told Hob that it hadn't occurred to him to ask about Hob's abduction, neither to offer comfort nor as a piece of evidence. Hob wasn't offended. That's just the way his Stranger was. He didn't ask for any further details, either, and Hob was secretly relieved. The bizarre burlesque show, the form Desire (or whoever) had chosen as "the easy way" to tempt Hob... Hob didn't think he was ready to share that information, particularly with a certain older sister present.

"They are toeing the line of how much they can interfere," Death mused. "And you think that will be enough for our brother?" Hob had to wonder if bringing in yet another Endless would be helpful.

"**If we present a good case, Destiny will listen.**"

Right. Dream. Desire. Death. Destiny. Stupid Hob. The pattern could've not been clearer.

"Then you better start working on a spectacular case." Death stood up and brushed her knuckles tenderly against Dream's cheek. Hob felt a warm peace wash over him as he realized he wasn't the only being out there treating Dream with the care he deserved. "But before that... Rest a while, little brother. For me?" She looked at Hob and added, "For us?"

Hob gave her a two-fingered salute and somehow managed to stop himself from commenting that he'd tie Dream to the bed if that's what it took to get him to rest. Again, regardless of the century, not the right comment to make in front of an older sister. "I'll, uh, I'll see to it."

"**This is conspiracy and treason,**" grumbled Dream, but he could not fool Hob, not when his shoulders were relaxed and his scowl was more of a resting bitch face than a scowl.

Death laughed and ruffled Dream's hair. "Of course it is. See you later, alligator." There was another sound of rustling feathers, but this time Hob managed to spot the shadow of wings on the wall around Death's silhouette before she disappeared.

Hob knew he had a big, dorky smile on his face when he turned to Dream. "Oh, I like her."

## Chapter 14

"**Can we have the conversation now?**"

They had been sitting in silence for almost two hours. After his sister left, Dream had closed his eyes and rested his chin on steepled fingers. In order to let him think or meditate or rest or whatever he needed to do in peace, Hob had grabbed a book he had left on the coffee table (a Portuguese novel around the Platonic cave myth). He didn't get very far in his reading; he kept glancing over to Dream, checking to see if he was alright, if he needed anything. It was after one of these side glances that Dream spoke. Hob didn't need to ask what conversation he was referring to.

"Duck, these are hardly peaceful times—"

"**There won't ever be such times, Hob,**" Dream growled and slammed his hands down on his lap, but Hob wasn't going to be dragged into his game.

"You very well know that I believe that there will be, and sooner than we expect," he answered calmly. "And all I want is for you not to be amidst some emotional turmoil when—"

"**I love you.**"

Hob opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again, and finally laughed softly, "When you do that." He could cry. He really could, any moment now, he could feel it rising up his chest like a balloon, but he was still laughing, and he could do both, they wouldn't be tears of sadness, anyway. "You know..." This time, his laugh really did have a sob caught somewhere in it. He ran a hand through his chin and the stubble gathering there since he hadn't shaved this morning. "I always thought I was going to be the first to say it."

Dream's smile was sharp, but there was warmth there, too. "**I win.**"

"You win. I love you."

"**I love you, too.**"

"I think we had already gone through that."

"**I know. I love you.**"

"You going for once for each century, dove?"

"**More like once for each second.**" Suddenly (and by suddenly he means _suddenly_, wisp-of-sand suddenly), Dream was no longer sitting next to him but towering in front of him. With a pale hand on his sternum, he pushed Hob down against the back of the couch and climbed onto his lap.

"Yeah, darling, that did _not_ count as the conversation. We need to talk like grown-ups about how we feel and how this is going to work, and I am going to hate myself for saying this but, Dream, could you please stop kissing my neck for two seconds and look at me?"

The reply was murmured against his pulse point. "**But I cannot kiss your lips because you won't stop talking.**" And then there was a shadow of teeth dragging over his skin. Arrogant cunt.

In this angle, Hob could put his mouth right next to Dream's ear. "Look at me." Dream did so begrudgingly, and his eyes were not blue but black, completely so, except for the twinkle of stars within them. Awestruck, Hob traced a sharp cheekbone with his thumb, and then he met Dream halfway for a searing kiss.

Kissing Dream of the Endless, actually kissing him, not just brushing lips against his hand or nuzzling his neck or hugging him or holding him or squeezing his arm or his thigh, actually kissing him felt beyond what any human, mortal or not, should be allowed to experience. With everything he had dared to do before now, Hob could've fooled himself into thinking he was loving something somewhat close to a man. Occasionally terrifying and intangible, sure, but almost a man. The chance to do that was no longer on the table. When Dream straddled his lap, Hob felt pinned to the spot, and yet Dream weighted nothing at all. He wasn't just light; there was no weight to him _at all_. And when he gasped and Hob used that chance to deepen the kiss, the inside of his mouth tasted like dozing off next to a cozy fireplace with a warm cup of tea in your hands. Not like the taste of the tea, or the lingering smell of the burning wood on your tongue. Like the experience itself, which should not be a taste to begin with. But it was, in Dream's mouth.

Hob wanted to know what the rest of him tasted like.

Dream didn't get the chance to complain about Hob breaking the kiss before Hob's mouth was latched onto his neck. Of course it didn't taste like skin; it tasted like a nap in a garden. Would it bruise? Hob was briefly reminded of the conversation he wanted to have that would include a discussion on boundaries (you don't go through six centuries worth of partners without learning that it's best to settle them beforehand instead of running headfirst into them in the worst possible ways), but then Dream whined and dug his nails into his biceps. Okay, yeah, it could wait, right?

"**Hob...**" He felt his name vibrate through Dream's throat. "**I want...**"

"Yeah, love, me too. Bedroom?" _Centuries_ he had waited for this. It was _not_ happening on a shitty couch. He nudged at Dream's hips because he weighted nothing at all yet no force on Earth could've moved him if he didn't choose to be moved.

Dream kissed him as he slipped off his lap, forcing Hob to scramble to follow him up lest they stop touching for even a second (unforgivable sin). It was not the first time Hob blindly led someone towards his room, and yet he still managed to miss the door and ended up pressing Dream against the wall next to it. Oh, well. They could have a little pit stop here, no harm, no foul.

With the hand that wasn't cradling Dream's head, Hob began to push Dream's coat off his shoulders. When it fell to the floor and revealed the short-sleeved black tee underneath (bare arms, scandalous), Dream shivered. Hob smirked against his lips. Oh, he couldn't wait to break past the stoney façade and make him squirm.

The reaction had been so delicious that Hob now used both hands to catch the hem of the T-shirt and push it upwards. He had pushed it all the way up to Dream's chest before he noticed that not only had Dream stopped kissing him, but he was pressing himself back against the wall like he wanted to disappear into it, eyes scrunched up tight. It was definitely not an expression of ecstasy or anything close to it.

"Dream?" No response. "Dream?" Hob repeated, more insistent. He released the shirt and it fell over Dream's torso once again. That finally got his attention.

When Dream opened his eyes again, for a split second they were a thousand miles away, but then he seemed to remember where he was. "**I-I apologize. That was... It will not happen again.**" He surged forwards to kiss Hob again, but Hob dodged him.

"Dream, what just happened?"

He almost stormed out, Hob was sure of it. Hob would've gotten really pissed if he had, not because of his own current situation—which by now was a half-situation and was quickly becoming a no-situation—but because Dream's reaction was worrying him the fuck out of his mind. The old Dream would've stormed out. This Dream just considered the option very heavily.

"Please, talk to me."

"**I...**" Dream crossed his arms over his chest, and maybe it was the bare arms and the rarity of only one layer of clothing, but once again he looked so painfully vulnerable. He had turned his head away from Hob. "**I have not been... without clothing... since I escaped from my imprisonment.**"

Hob saw red. He had never wanted to learn anything about Dream's imprisonment beyond what Dream shared freely, but pictures had formed in his mind, as minds sometimes do without permission. He had pictured some sort of twisted temple, fit for a being beyond godly divinity but a prison nonetheless. He had pictured a common cell, like many he had seen himself. He had _never_ pictured anywhere where the basic decency of clothing was not granted. Trying to be gentle despite the rage coursing through him (one of the Hobs of the past would've already put his fist through the wall, he knew better now, that would not help), he bent down to retrieve Dream's coat and wrapped it around his shoulders. "Say nothing more, sweeting. We don't have to do anything you don't want—"

"**But I _want_, Hob Gadling!**" Dream roughly shoved the coat off and grabbed Hob by the wrists. "**I. Want. _You_. Deeply. Ardently.**"

Hob had learned his lesson of the day about letting his dick do the thinking for him, which is the only reason why he didn't snog Dream silly after hearing that. "You have me. And we can figure out a way for you to have me in any other way you want without risking your comfort."

Dream's grip on his wrists softened, and a pensive expression appeared on his features. After a moment of consideration, there was a whisper of shifting sands and Dream was no longer wearing his coat, shirt, jeans, or boots. Instead, he was wearing a silk robe. _Just_ a silk robe. It was black (obviously) and long enough to pool around Dream's feet. The tiny stars on it were embroidered with shimmering black thread, so they seemed to appear and disappear depending on how the light hit them. Or maybe they _were_ appearing and disappearing. "**Will this do?**"

Hob managed to speak despite his throat suddenly feeling completely dry. "You tell me, dove. Do you feel comfortable?"

To Hob's relief, Dream seemed to actually consider the question instead of just rushing through and ignoring his feelings like before. "**Yes. Yes, I do. As ridiculous as it sounds, I think that with this I can trick my body into feeling covered without it, ah, getting in the way.**" As he said those last words, he gazed at Hob through lowered lashes, and Hob wanted to travel back in time just to tell his 1789 self that yes, that look he is giving you means exactly what you think it does, have your way with him on the tavern floor.

But alas, his 2022 self still had some talking left to do, as much as he wanted to shrug it off as a common turn of phrase. "It's not ridiculous, Dream. Whatever you need to do to feel okay, it is never ridiculous, like how I avoid bodies of water larger than a tub or how I always wash my face with warm water. If it stops the bad shit from popping up, it's not ridiculous. That's what my therapist told me." Dream's eyebrow rose with an unspoken question. "Yes, I have a therapist. Yes, I have to lie to him constantly. Yes, it still helps despite all the lying. Can we stop talking about him now?"

Dream started toying with the hem of Hob's shirt and smirked. "**Can we stop talking altogether?**"

"Are you okay?"

"**With you around, my knight?**" Dream threw his arms around Hob's neck. "**How can I not?**"

Dream's mouth now tasted like the sleep that welcomes you after a long day.

---

Dream didn't need to breathe, but he was doing it anyways. Maybe it was for Hob's sake, maybe he just enjoyed the experience. Each puff of air that left his nose rustled the thick brown hairs next to his head where it was pillowed on Hob's chest. With one elegant finger, he traced patterns on Hob's abdomen, which twitched occasionally when Dream touched a particularly ticklish spot. Hob, for his part, ran his hand up and down Dream's spine. He could feel it even through his robe; he needed to reiterate his offer of venison pasties, get some fat on those bones.

"All those years," he mused out loud, "and we didn't do this sooner. I mean, I don't know about you, but I've loved you... well, for a while now."

More than seeing it, he felt Dream's smile against his chest. "**I fell in love with you in the year 1689.**"

Hob's laugh rumbled deep within him. "Oh, you absolute _ass_."

Dream immediately rolled off him and lifted himself up on his forearms to stare right into Hob's soul through his eyes like he was so fond of doing. "**I am not joking.**"

Hob frowned. "Love, I was..." He gestured vaguely with the hand that had not remained stubbornly glued to Dream's back despite the shift in position. "I looked and smelled like the rancid turd of a seasick possum."

Dream rolled his eyes in a way that was adorably human. "**Thank you for that lovely image.**" The robe began slipping off one shoulder, and as a knee-jerk reaction, Hob grabbed the collar and pulled it back up. When he released it, Dream caught his hand and laced their fingers together. "**But I mean it. 1689. The year I began loving you.**"

"But..."

Dream, the petulant brat, put his free hand over Hob's mouth. No talking during the King's speech, okay. "**I realized I cared about you beyond an... _experiment_ between my sister and I when you told me of the horrors you had gone through. I was certain that that was it, that you were going to request my sister's gift, and it hurt. Deeply. To think of all you had suffered, to think that you had given up, to think...**" His voice got smaller. "**To think I'd lose you.**" He paused, tears beginning to gather in his eyes, and Hob squeezed his hand to bring him back to the present. He had seen tears like that on that day, but he had chalked it up to a trick of the light. No Lord cries for a beggar. "**And then,**" Dream continued, "**you told me I was crazy for even asking that. You said you had so much to live for, and the hope in your eyes... It was so bright, I thought myself blinded by it. And in that moment, I knew I loved you. And I have loved you ever since.**"

Not being able to say anything in response, Hob simply kissed the hand over his mouth. Dream conceded and removed his hand, not without dragging Hob's bottom lip down while he did so. Hob smirked. "If you had asked me to guess, I would've honestly said 1789, judging by that look you gave me."

Dream chuckled, "**Ah, yes. 1789. I did want to do some unspeakable things to you in that moment, I'll admit.**"

Hob chased the hand that had just been removed to kiss it further, tips of fingers, palm, pulse point. "Why didn't you, then?" He regretted his words when all playfulness vanished from Dream's eyes.

"**Like I said before, I was scared. Attachments of the Endless to mortals... dangerous things. And you may not be mortal, but you are human, and Destiny's rules are often muddled and two-faced.**" He tried a small smile, but Hob could tell it was forced. "**And then there's my pride.**"

"Ah. The third person in this relationship." He got a sharp poke to the gut for that, but it was worth it because Dream's smile was now genuine. "You didn't ask, but as for me: 1389. The moment I first saw you, you weird posh boy with a disgrace for a haircut who would've gotten his throat slit for that stupid ruby of yours, had you been human."

"**Really? It was that easy?**"

"Shut up," Hob grumbled. "And to be honest, I thought all you wanted was to have me on my knees behind the tavern, and that all that "_in a hundred years time_" shit was the poor excuse for flirting you had picked up in whatever castle you had crawled out of for the first time in your life. I watched you leave and waited a respectable amount of time to pretend we weren't leaving together, but when I got outside, poof, gone. Very disappointing." He titled his head, considering. "And then I didn't die. Less disappointing."

Dream buried his hand in Hob's hair. "**Must you always be so crude?**"

Leaning into the touch, Hob murmured, "You didn't mind me being crude half an hour ago."

It was now Dream's turn to grumble, "**Shut up,**" adding a tug to Hob's hair, but the warning was overshadowed by the dusty blush that rose to his cheeks.

"C'mere," Hob laughed, twisting his leg to pull Dream back down. Not done being a brat for the day, Dream let himself fall like a puppet whose strings had been cut and landed on Hob's chest. After placing a soft kiss on his forehead, Hob placed two fingers under his chin and gently lifted his head so they were eye to eye. "_Myne owne hertis rote_," he whispered and greedily devoured the spark of adoration that appeared in Dream's eyes.

## Chapter 15

Hob thought he was just resting his eyes, but he still had some trouble realizing Dream had spoken to him and some more trying to figure out what he had said. "Y'said something, dove?"

"**I _said_,**" Dream insisted, a tad shy of fully annoyed, "**I have an idea for what we can do next.**"

Hob's eyes refused to open, heavy as they were, but he blindly found a bony hip to languidly stroke, silk soft under his fingers. "Gimme a few moments more, dearest, I'm not ready to get it up again just yet," he mumbled, only half joking.

A hand swatted him away from the hip he had found, but considering the almost-silent chuckle that rumbled through the body pressed flush against his, he wasn't in too much trouble. "**About the _war_, Robert.**" This returned Hob's ability to open his eyes, and the first thing he saw was Dream watching him intently. "**Not the most common subject for pillow talk, I am aware, but time is of the essence, and I believe I have fulfilled my sister's request for rest. You can report back to her that it was completed to satisfaction.**" The arch of Dream's eyebrow told Hob that the way he had squirmed under Death's gaze had been noted and _would_ be exploited to antagonize him.

"Bastard," Hob bit back. "I am sorry for having manners. And for being very reasonably terrified of your sister." It wasn't comfortable, but he managed to crane his neck to peck a quick kiss to Dream's lips without either of them having to move. "Your plan. I'm listening."

Dream's eyes lingered on his lips for a moment like he was regretting talking shop in bed, but, unfortunately, he regained focus soon enough. "**We need to gather as much information as we can about my sibling's involvement in the invasion. If there's some sort of agreement between them and the Morningstar, it's a delicate one. Desire is not one to make alliances. Rather, they deal more in blackmail.**"

"The Devil made a deal with the devil," Hob mused. His pinkie, on its own volition, was tracing Dream's eyebrows. He had never been good at laser-like focus on a single matter (and his therapist had some words, or rather a four-letter acronym, to say about it).

"**Something like that. Lucifer is not standing as my sibling's equal in their arrangement.**" Dream titled his head towards Hob's touch, and it hit Hob that, yeah, this was their fucked-up version of pillow talk. "**Which is wonderful news for us. Hell's creatures are a vicious pack. Any sign of weakness, be it in the lowest of demons or in one of their Dukes, stinks like blood in the water.**"

"So if their leader is being held by the short and curlies by some Endless..."

"**...rumors have already spread about it,**" Dream completed, "**and there _will_ be demons who are unhappy with the arrangement. We just have to establish communication with one such demon, and I know where to start.**" And on that sweet and tender note, Dream brushed a kiss against Hob's jaw and slipped away from his grip. By the time he had rolled out of bed, his silk robe was gone, replaced by his usual jeans, shirt and jacket.

"And how, pray tell, does one establish communication with a demon?" Hob asked, mostly just to stall for time, and scratched idly at his belly.

Dream was narrowing his eyes, and Hob was certain he was considering grabbing him by the ankle and dragging him out of bed if he continued to play dumb. "**Through an exorcist, of course.**" Of course. "**Now, I can put you to sleep and take you to our destination as you are, or you can get dressed and come with me willingly.**"

"Alright, alright." Hob chose to exit the bed on the other side just to have an excuse to turn his back on Dream and hide the silly smile threatening to split his face in half. Dream could've been gone to see this exorcist before finishing his sentence, leaving Hob to drown in worry until he returned. Instead, he wanted Hob to come with him, willingly or unwillingly (it would always be willingly). All of the Hobs of the past had been right about one thing: there was softness to him if one knew where to look.

Another shower would've been nice, even with the neat trick Dream had pulled a while ago (which Hob was sure was less about being nice and more about being disgusted by the humanity of all those fluids), but Hob got the feeling that if he wasn't by the door in less than five minutes, Dream _would_ kidnap him mid-shower. This proved to be the right call when, after hastily putting back on what had been thrown around his room, he found Dream already by the back door, the one that led down the side of the Inn instead of having to walk through it. "**About time.**" He opened the door, and the suburban London evening greeted them, extensive and vulnerable. No longer a cozy bubble where fears could be laid bare with the safety that only the soft touch of a lover would be there to receive them.

"Duck, wait." Dream's playful annoyance quickly turned to puzzlement when Hob touched his arm lightly and looked at him with concern. "How are you feeling?" Hob didn't need to say more. He could see in Dream's eyes that he was also remembering this morning, how he had clung to Hob and had suffered for his creations. As much as he loved seeing Dream smile, Hob knew that all of that was still lurking somewhere under the surface, and he refused to be complicit in pretending it wasn't there.

"**We are going to fix this, aren't we?**" Dream said, a statement or a plea, not a question.

Hob nodded, and Dream crossed the frontier of their bubble out into the rest of the Waking World.

## Chapter 16

First, Dream hailed a cab. He performed the gesture with such ease and confidence that he could've passed as any other bloke leaving his 9 to 5 and hailing any of the many cabs speeding through Central London. Except this _wasn't_ Central London; cabs were very rare around here. The street was almost deserted, and the handful of drivers that went by gave Dream a funny look. When no carriage appeared to answer His Majesty's summons, Dream made a small sound of frustration.

"No cabs around here, love," Hob explained softly.

"**There are currently several hundred in the Dreaming, driven by humans dreaming of their jobs as cabbies.**" Dream let the fact hang heavy between them without having to put into words why he hadn't called upon one of those cabs instead of trying to do it the human way. He stared at a passing car with his patented cold fury (causing another funny look) as if all of his problems were caused by the driver's refusal to accept a hitchhiker. "**I did not want to use my sand because it would not be comfortable for you, but it seems the Waking World does not want to cooperate with me today.**"

Hob gently lowered Dream's arm and placed a hand on the small of his back to lead him towards the back of the New Inn. "I have a car, I can drive us," and then, because Dream had changed in the past 133 years and Hob wanted him to know it hadn't gone unnoticed, he added, "Thank you for your consideration."

They drove into the city in silence. Dream sat with his back straight as a rod, and he was looking out the window at the darkening sky. It was always night somewhere in the world, and there was always someone sleeping somewhere in the world, but Hob guessed that the physical closeness to a city full of people preparing for their nightly trip to the Dreaming was particularly painful. All of a sudden, a cab sounded quite nice, with the freedom to gather Dream into his arms instead of being bound to a wheel and shift stick. As it was, Hob could only give Dream's hand a quick brush with his pinkie to see if Dream took the initiative to come closer. Dream didn't react. Hob did not try a second time.

Hob cleared his throat. "Driving around can be good to clear one's mind, but I'm going to need an address if you need to go somewhere in particular." Could exorcists be summoned to any place that was convenient? Or would that go against their whole deal?

Dream said nothing, so it took Hob a moment to catch, out of the corner of his eye, that he was being offered a piece of paper. "Oh. Okay." Hob weaved out of traffic to pull over and type the address into Waze. (Was this Dream's handwriting? Hob wanted to think it was. It fitted him. Thin, angular cursive.)

The address corresponded to a flat in the last floor of a building that looked about thirty years old. Hob barely had a chance to find a parking spot before Dream was out of the car and striding towards the building. Hob had half a mind to chase him without even locking the car, but crime did not care about grieving Dream Lords and their worried boyfriends, and Hob didn't want to lose his beloved classic after so many years. By the time Hob made it inside the building, Dream was already stomping up the stairs.

Had he just called himself Dream's boyfriend?

By the time Hob caught up with Dream, they were already on the last floor. Dethroned or not, Hob was sure some dream magic had gone into making sure he struggled to keep up. He wouldn't put it past Dream to be a bastard like that. _Catch up_ with him wasn't even the right way to put it. _Crash into him when he stopped dead at the top of the stairs_ was more like it.

As Hob steadied himself so he wouldn't take a tumble down to the previous landing, Dream finally spoke. "**I must warn you, Hob. The resemblance is uncanny, but she is a descendant, not the woman herself. She does not know you or know anything about your...**" A quick glance to the side, like he was James fucking Bond saying _eyes and ears everywhere_ with a pointed look. "**..._longevity_.**"

"You have to know that's a bloody ominous thing to say, right?"

Dream ignored him and knocked sharply.

The sound of steps came from within, followed by "Coming, coming", then a clang as something toppled over, then "Ow, fuck, why is this in the fucking way?". And yeah, that voice. Hob knew that voice. From where did he know that voice?

The first thing she said when she opened the door was, "Oh. It's you," while staring straight at Dream.

The first thing Hob said when she opened the door was, "Jesus _fucking_ H. Christ."

Dream gave him a look that said, _I literally_ just _told you_. She followed his gaze (and also the expletive, quite possibly) and regarded Hob with curiosity. "I'm sorry, have we met?"

Dream replied quickly for him, "**No, you haven't.**" Hob would've complained that he was perfectly capable of answering for himself, but in full honesty, he did not trust himself to say anything at the moment.

"Right..." The descendant-not-the-woman-herself-Hob-get-it-together eyed them both again for good measure. "Well, then. The name's Johanna Constantine, pleasure to meet you."

The name felt like the last fucking straw, and it took Hob a moment to gather his thoughts enough to remember how to introduce himself. Gadlen? Gads? Wait, no, he had given up on changing his name around for about a century now. Ha. Ironic. "Robert Gadling. Pleasure is all mine," he said, trying and failing to keep the poison out of his voice.

If Constantine noticed, she showed no sign. "I better invite you inside before our mutual friend breaks in again." She threw a small smile at Dream like they were sharing an inside joke, and Hob was ecstatic to see that Dream did not react. Who did she think she was, calling Dream their "mutual friend", trying to have inside jokes with him? When she stepped back into her home, Hob made sure to walk in behind her before Dream, keeping himself between the two at all times.

She ushered them into a cramped living room, saying this and that and "Sorry about the mess" (and Hob thought _he_ was a hoarder). Hob ignored her. As she busied herself moving a pile of magazines from a chair to another larger pile off in a corner, Hob leaned in closer to Dream and hissed, "The name's the fucking same."

"**I believe it is customary among humans to name their children after their ancestors as a sign of respect.**" Funny guy.

"Yeah, I know, I've got the same name as my "father" who started the New Inn, and as my "grandfather" who gave him the money for it, and as my "great-grandfather" who fought in World War II," Hob made the corresponding air quotes right in Dream's face to make sure his point wasn't lost. And to be a bitch. "And I also share an uncanny resemblance with all of them, but _guess fucking what_?!"

Dream didn't even have the decency of getting annoyed at his gesticulations. "**If she were immortal and the same woman we faced in 1789, I'd know.**"

"I forgot you know everything, Your Lordship," Hob grumbled. He was starting to wish their night with this Constantine went similarly to the one with the other Constantine. He'd like to have something to punch.

"Right." After fighting a losing battle against the pile of magazines and gravity, Constantine joined them in the living room, taking the chair she had cleared while they sat on the couch. "What is it this time? Sandman lost his sand again?"

"**Nothing has been lost.**" Dream was still reacting with indifference to Constantine's familiarity, but that didn't lessen the twist of pain in Hob's gut. It was the same twist of pain he had felt when he had asked Dream _You know everyone, don't you?_ after he had recited Lushing Lou's life story, and it had only worsened when Dream told him Lady Johanna had **_undertaken a task for him and succeeded admirably_**. And here was the descendant, yet another human that seemed to know more about Dream in her tiny lifespan than Hob had known in the first six hundred and thirty-three years of their acquaintance. It was a close relative to the twist of pain caused by watching a Stranger clad in black leather lead a shit playwright out of a tavern. Why not him? Why hold him at arm's length? Why go to others with tasks and quests and commissions when Hob would've done it all for him, no questions asked, no payment required?

He shook off the ridiculous pang of jealousy. It was different now. Dream trusted him now. Hell, right now he was entangled in quite an important quest from Dream. _With_ Dream. Not a human errand boy on his own, but a _team_.

Dream was still speaking while Hob was distracted by his silly human feelings. "**I need to establish a line of communication with a demon. I cannot do it through any means of my own, and I was hoping a woman of your expertise could give me the assistance I require. Properly rewarded, of course.**"

Constantine pursed her lips. "I'm your secretary now, that's it? Dialing the phone for you and all that? Why can't you do it yourself?"

Hob decided to intercede to meet Constantine in her level of informality instead of sounding vaguely like a vampire soliciting a prostitute. "It's more about backdoor shenanigans." Well, that was even worse than the vampire john. Great job, Gadling. "Insider trading, classified information, that sort of thing," he amended.

"Mm-hm." Constantine nodded slowly. "What's the demon's name?"

"**Any that reaches out to us will do,**" Dream replied, and that did not sound like a fully fleshed-out plan to Hob, but no one ever asked the peasant for his opinion on demon summonings.

Constantine, to Hob's great chagrin, seemed to agree with him. "We are not twelve-year-olds at a slumber party with a Hello Kitty Ouija board. You don't really mean _any_ demon. You've got something up your sleeve, Dreamlord, _and_ you're expecting trouble, or else you wouldn't have brought your bodyguard."

Hob felt a cruel sort of pride at that. So she _had_ noticed his behavior and had realized that he's willing to break as many bones as it took to keep Dream safe. Good. Dream, however, wasn't so happy. He leaned forwards and growled, "**Hob is not my bodyguard.**" Prideful as always.

Hob squeezed his shoulder and eased him back into the couch. "I'm sure she knows you can take care of yourself, d—" He bit his tongue. A business negotiation during times of war was hardly the place for endearments. "Dream," he finished awkwardly.

When Dream turned to look at him, Hob forgot where he was or what he was doing. All that mattered were Dream's eyes on him with the intensity of a thousand exploding stars. "**That's not what I meant. You are not some hired muscle and I will not have you referred as such. You are my friend.**" The uncertainty of what they had yet to name danced behind hs words.

"I can be more than one thing," Hob teased. Friend. Lover. Knight. Bodyguard. Whatever Dream needed, he'd be. He butted Dream's chin gently with his knuckles. "Don't put me in a box."

"**You've always had a skill for taking up several trades,**" Dream chuckled.

"Oi! How about we summon a demon and then you can go fuck on your own couch?"

God, Hob really wanted to punch Constantine.

## Chapter 17

Constantine's "office" was probably meant to be a guest bedroom, and the fact that she was able to clear enough space to place a small round table at the center of it was a testament to her supernatural connections. She then started to rummage about, plucking out candles, a mat, chalk, and other exorcist knickknacks from boxes and drawers. Seeing her try to unlock a cupboard with an armful of antique candlesticks, Hob reached forward to help, but she slapped his hand away. "Your Mummy might have raised you to be a gentleman, but I'd rather you not touch my shit, alright?"

Hob rubbed the back of his hand and shot daggers at the back of Constantine's head. "My Mam most definitely didn't do that, but now that I think of it, she _did_ tell me not to get involved in demon summonings, so I'm just going to let you do you."

Constantine muttered, "Mama's boy," as she placed her kit on the table. She began arranging the candles in a circle over the mat and began chanting in Latin under her breath while tracing a circle and various sigils with the chalk.

As a rule, Hob had steered clear of the occult throughout his long life. The last thing he needed was some spirit that had died decades ago recognizing him, or his Stranger getting miffed when he found out Hob had other magical friends and taking his wonderful gift away. That didn't mean he hadn't had occasional run-ins with the supernatural—hard to live for so long without ever seeing at least one thing that defied explanation—but even then he had bid it a good day and walked the other way. Hearing Constantine's chants and seeing the lights begin to flicker, even after everything he had experienced lately (he had killed demons with his own hands, for fuck's sake), Hob's instincts told him to grab Dream's hand and run. Thankfully, he had enough of his trademark foolhardy courage to stand his ground.

From the bits and pieces he remembered from back when Mass was in Latin, Hob recognized that Constantine needed a name to say in the incantation when she faltered and glanced at Dream. Uncooperative as always, Dream merely said, "**I'll take it from here,**" and approached the table, and Constantine moved to stand next to Hob off to the side. Dream placed his hands within the circle and his eyes turned pitch black. Immediately, the room was filled with a thousand voices whispering. To Hob, they were an unintelligible hum, but Dream tilted his head this way and that and muttered, "**No. No. Absolutely not. Leave. Not you,**" and the number of voices started decreasing.

"I knew he wouldn't go for _any_ demon," Constantine said, and Hob shushed her.

Finally, Dream smiled one of those awful smiles that were all nightmare, no warmth. "**You.**" The voices went silent, and Hob expected the lucky chosen one to start whispering their intel. He would've preferred them to have whispered their intel while remaining a disembodied voice.

Instead, there was suddenly someone else with them in the room. They stood next to the table Constantine had set up, opposite to Dream. (Weren't demons supposed to stand only within the summoning circle and if they were outside it, shit was fucked? At least that's how it works in the movies.) They had dark blonde hair styled in a wavy pixie cut, but unlike the other blondes that Hob currently had had up to here with, they barely reached 5'3''. In fact, Hob wouldn't have picked them out in a crowd of students, with their baggy black and white flannel shirt and jeans mended in several places with colorful patches. Well, maybe the murderous look in their green eyes would've set them apart, unless it was the final day of the semester and Hob was handing out grades.

"I have to say, I am honored to meet you," the demon said, even though they really didn't look very thrilled, "but I am unsure of how to address you, sir. Considering that you are not a king anymore and all that."

Hob could see the muscles in Dream's jaw twitch from where he stood. "**"Sir" will do. I am still one of the Endless, child. Still, you don't have to worry too much. Our interaction will be short-lived. You know why I am allowing you to be here. Speak.**"

The demon fiddled with a hole in their jeans that they apparently hadn't had the time to patch up. "I know things about the Lightbringer. You wish to know these things, too. I am happy to pass on my knowledge..."

"**...for a price,**" Dream finished.

"Yes, but it's just more knowledge. You must know that that's what I like; that's why you chose me among all those gossipers and bootlickers, after all." Their eyes swept across the room and over Hob and Constantine. "Anything anyone here wants to offer, not just you, sir."

An opportunity to stand between Dream and the line of fire? Hob's favorite type of opportunity. "I know a shitload of things," Hob piped up. "All of them absolutely useless, but you did say anything goes."

The demon's eyes flashed green, not as a trick of the light, but as an actual neon outline firing on and off momentarily. "You always sell yourself short, Dr. Gadling. Your knowledge is very welcome."

"See, right there, someone might overhear you calling me "doctor", and they might think I can help them with a broken leg or with a heart attack, but all I can offer is a dissertation on warfare as a trade for the common man of Medieval England." Knowledge. He could do this. This was a lecture. He could do lectures. He wrung his hands as he tried to think of a topic, but his brain was suddenly even more barren than it had been before he learned to read. All eyes were on him. "Right. Um."

"**I can supply my own payment for my query, Hob,**" Dream interrupted. Hob waved him off.

"I got this, love. You called me a scholar, remember? You said, and I quote, "**You've become quite a scholar, haven't you?**" The kid wants to learn something new, and I can help them with that. It's literally my job now." Hob clapped as the contents of the last lecture he had prepared before his life had been flipped upside down by demon wars came to him. "Right. So there is this bloke, Simon de Montfort, and he does alright, but he still has a bone to pick with the King..."

In the comfort of his current trade, the words flowed out of Hob. He would even go as far as calling it one of his best lectures, despite the small and odd audience. Dream looked absolutely fascinated, which only spurred Hob further. Constantine looked like she wanted to summon another demon just so it would kill her. The demon looked puzzled, but they did not interrupt Hob. Once he had painted a pretty decent biographical picture with generous details on the Second Barons' War, Hob paused. "Is that... was that...?"

"That was sufficient payment, Dr. Gadling," the demon replied. "It is not what I usually receive when I draw knowledge out of humans, but it's an acceptable offering nonetheless."

"Bloody boring, is what it was," Constantine grumbled, but Hob ignored her in favor of bowing minutely for his demonic audience.

"Now, for my part." The demon returned their attention to Dream, spreading their palms, and their eyes flashed their neon contours once more. When they spoke again, their voice had an additional raspy quality that hadn't been there before, reminding Hob of times before digital audio. "The Morningstar was planning an invasion of your realm—former realm, I apologize—as a first step towards their return to the Silver City when Desire of the Endless contacted them. I obviously was not privy to their meeting, even my master was blind to what transpired between the Endless and the Morningstar, but it is easy to deduce from how quickly the invasion evolved that the Morningstar received invaluable intel on the inner workings of your realm."

"After this, Desire of the Endless was not seen in Hell again, but the Morningstar was no longer the head of the army, not really. Sometimes they would change their orders, but they seemed reluctant to do so. They often refrained from making decisions on the spot, claiming that they wanted to weight their options first, but when the time came for their verdict, they weren't always convinced on the course of action. And the _coup de grâce_: a demon from the circles of lust and the like was enlisted to aid in the abduction of some enemy knight, who knows who." A sly glance from the demon told Hob that they knew exactly who. He felt his face grow hot at the mention of a lust demon. Maybe he should've told Dream the whole story about his abduction; he didn't want to know what conclusions the other was currently drawing.

"Not too unusual a plan," the demon continued, "but what was unusual was that the knight was never brought to Hell, and soon after the King of Dreams abdicated, my, oh my. Ever since then, there have been no new orders, unlike the constant shifting strategies of before. And the Morningstar seems quite agitated about this." The demon tucked their hands into the back pockets of their jeans and began swaying on the balls of their feet.

"Didn't we..." Hob began hesitantly in case the demon wanted to say something else. "Didn't we already know all of that?"

"**We suspected,**" Dream corrected. "**But now we have confirmation that Desire was involved in the invasion _and_ that they enlisted a demon to draw you out of the Dreaming. We also have a witness, and Destiny respects the testimony of their master.**"

"Isn't Lucifer their—?"

"Hell politics are complicated," Constantine explained sharply. "There are subdivisions and sub-masters and a whole tangled mess of loyalties and bureaucracy."

Hob cracked a smile. "Sounds like Hell."

Just like one of his students would, the demon rolled their eyes at his joke. "Sure. Can I go now?"

Dream seemed startled in a very uncharacteristic way for a second and then, in an even more uncharacteristic way, said, "**Of course. I'm sorry. You are dismissed.**" He broke the circle with his thumb, and the demon vanished. After wiping the chalk from his thumb on Constantine's fancy exorcist mat, he turned to Hob with a glint in his eyes. "**Doctor?**"

Hob shrugged. "There was an opening in one of the grad courses, and I have nothing but time."

## Chapter 18

"So... that went well."

After Dream had paid Constantine with a wad of cash that had magically appeared in his coat pocket, Hob had offered some awkward pleasantries as goodbye, which Constantine had ignored in favour of counting the money. They were now back outside, but instead of walking back to the car, Dream appeared too preoccupied with staring up at the sky pensively. When Hob spoke to get his attention, a moment passed before he answered. "**Hm? Oh, yes. It went well.**"

"I was being sarcastic, love."

Dream finally turned towards Hob with a puzzled expression. "**But it _did_ go well.**"

"It didn't go _bad_, sure, but I was expecting something..." He waved his hand as he searched for the right term. "_Conclusive_. A holy weapon to strike down Lucifer and when I grabbed it, there would be some level up sounds and I'd be beefier. Or something."

Dream rolled his eyes. "**You really want a holy weapon, don't you? Isn't the knowledge we acquired good enough for you?**"

"Once a brutish fighter, always a brutish fighter, I s'ppose," Hob replied with a shrug.

Dream crossed his arms over his chest. "**You say that even though you just proved yourself to be knowledgeable, _and_ you've proven time and time again to be a gentleman.**"

With a mischievous grin, Hob reached into the pocket of his jacket. "Would a gentleman have done something like this?" He pulled out a small pendant hanging from a chain. He had no idea what it was, but it looked like gold, and if his trained eyes said it was gold, then it was gold. "I'm sorry," he added even if both of them knew he didn't mean it, "I had to. It was either this or punching her."

"**You have a quick hand, Hob Gadling. I am reminded of how you stole some silver cutlery from the White Horse back in 1689.**"

Hob's eyes widened. "Oh. You noticed that, then?"

A sly smirk started to toy at Dream's lips. "**Didn't you find it bizarre to find silver cutlery at the White Horse, even though they usually use more common metals?**"

Hob thrust the pendant back into his pocket with anger so exaggerated it could only be fake. "Oh, so indirect charity. That's what that was."

If Hob had to choose a word to describe the way Dream caressed the side of his face then, it would be "condescending." "**I enjoy using finery, Hob. Not everything is about you.**"

Hob swatted his hand away. "Alright, alright, milord who enjoys using finery. What are your next orders? We're in a tight schedule, remember? Or did you just want an excuse to scurry out of my bed?"

Hob wished Dream would push back a little more and keep fucking around a bit (to see what he would find out, as the kids say), but Dream snapped into business mode immediately. "**I'm sending you back to the Dreaming. They need you there to finish pushing the Lightbringer out of my realm.**"

"Hold up. I'm going back to the Dreaming all by my lonesome while you go face Destiny? That's what you're going to do, isn't it? State your case?"

"**No, I—**" Dream wasn't meeting his eyes anymore. "**I'm going back to Desire. We can settle this between us; there's no need to bother Destiny directly.**"

Maybe Dream had forgotten that Hob had been there (and had been mostly conscious) the last time Dream and Desire had _settled_ something between them. If that was the easy path to take in this situation, then Hob would very much like never to meet Destiny in person. Unless, of course, it was to stand between him and Dream if there was trouble. Speaking of... "I don't know how your rules work, dove, but I don't like the idea of you back in Desire's realm without me there backing you up."

The anger that flashed across Dream's features was not exaggerated or playacted in the slightest. Hob had played the protective card one too many times. "**I'm starting to think you truly believe I can't take care of myself, Robert, even though—**"

"Dream—"

"**_Even though_, if I may remind you, there were millennia upon millennia before your birth where I managed to survive just fine.**"

"Dream, it's not about you!" Hob's words surprised both Dream and himself, and it took him a beat to finally face the truth that had always been there, in the deepest corners of his heart. "I mean, of course it's about _you_, I want to protect _you_, what I mean is that it's not about you being in need of protecting. It's about..." He ran his hand through his hair. "It's about me needing to protect you. It's all I can give you, love. My passion, my strength, my rage. Once, I thought that what I could give you, what you wanted from me, was my soul. Then, I thought I could offer riches and feasts and fucken _lamb_. Then I got a little taste of what it was like to protect you, and fuck, if it wasn't the sweetest delicacy. And _then_, when you really needed it, when you were... _in there_, where was I? Drinking myself under the table because I thought the man I had loved for centuries didn't even consider me a friend."

Dream's voice wasn't even a whisper. "**You couldn't have known.**"

"Maybe I should've. If my purpose, if my entire reason for existing is to be there for you when you need it, then maybe there should've been some Batsignal going off in my heart to let me know I had to drop everything and rush to save you. If not, then what's the point of me?" He pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes. He was _not_ crying in the street outside _Constantine's_ flat.

"**Humans don't have a point.**"

Hob lowered his hands slowly. Okay. Maybe he _was_ going to cry in the street outside Constantine's flat. "What." He didn't even bother to make it sound like a question.

"**Maybe that wasn't the best way to phrase it. What I'm trying to say is that there is no singular, overarching purpose to a single human's life. I thought you of all people already knew that. You've been, just to name a few trades, a bandit, a stock broker, a nobleman, a typographer, a brothel owner, a husband, a _father_, I don't think it's necessary for me to continue. Of course, one could argue that in terms of numbers, they have been several different lifetimes, but it has only been one human throughout it all. You. Me? My purpose is my function, and my function is my existence, but you are infinite, Hob.**" Dream's smile was so genuine it felt almost blasphemous for it to be here, in public, in some random London street. "**And I love you for it.**"

Hob could only stand there, dumbfounded. Dream made it sound so obvious that Hob felt like a petulant fool for what he had said before. He knew from previous experience that it wasn't that easy, that those feelings were not gone for good, not yet, but at least right now the fog had cleared momentarily. "First of all," he began once he regained his voice, "I love you, too. Second of all... fuck, I've been one clingy bastard, haven't I?"

Dream took Hob's right hand with both of his own and pressed it against his chest. "**You have been very attentive during these rough times I'm facing. I just wish you didn't put yourself in needless danger without thinking, took some time for yourself every now and then, got enough rest every night, and didn't say things like "I'll rest when I'm dead."**" Dream kissed the hand he was holding and let it go.

"Wow. The ol' complaints box has been filling up for quite some time now, huh?"

"**It should not surprise you by now that I am fastidious.**"

"Maybe not. But that doesn't mean I'm not going to give you hell about it." Hob pulled in Dream by the lapels of his coat, but his plans to plant a kiss on Dream's forehead were immediately foiled when Dream kissed his lips instead. Not that he was complaining.

"**We'll meet in neutral grounds. Desire and I,**" Dream whispered once they separated.

"And I'll go help in the Dreaming. I miss the gang, and I'm sure they miss you very much, too."

Dream smiled sadly. "**Give them my best.**"

"I will. Now, let's go home some I can drink some of my extra fancy herbal tea, you can tuck me in, and off to Dreamland I'll go."

"**There is a more direct way to do it, if you wish to hurry.**"

"So no holy weapon _and_ you're not tucking me in? I might start feeling neglected here."

Dream had gotten out his pouch of sand and gave Hob an irritated look as he emptied some onto his outstretched palm. "**Robert...**"

"Fine, fine." Hob opened his arms to the side and closed his eyes. "Hit me."

"**Stay safe**," he heard Dream say as he felt the first grains of sand tickle his face, and he answered, "I will. For you," just before losing consciousness.

## Chapter 19

"This is highly unorthodox, dearest brother."

Desire's voice seemed to be coming from everywhere at once. That very well could be a trick they were playing with their powers, but it could also be a perfectly natural effect caused by the location Dream had chosen. Theaters were designed to carry the voices of the actors across the entire hall (without microphones, in the most traditional designs). When there was no audience to absorb part of the sound waves or distort them with their coughing and shuffling, the effect was stronger. In fact, Dream's own boots clicked louder than they usually did when he turned to face his sibling as they sauntered in from stage left. He met them halfway.

"**We both appreciate good theater. I considered this to be a symbolic middle ground for us.**"

Hob didn't appear in the battlefield, or even a makeshift center of operations on the sidelines of it. He was back in Dream's castle, in the library, a couple of meters away from the table where the Dreaming's council, now led by Lucienne, was holding a session. They didn't notice him at first. "Uh. Hullo."

Lucienne straightened up with a start and narrowly missed hitting Matthew, who squawked and hopped away. "Robert! You... are here..." As she spoke, she not-very-discreetly tired to look over Hob's shoulder and around him, as if the rightful king of this place and a bloke who stood at almost 1.80 meters and liked to be the center of attention would be shyly hiding behind him.

"There is also the teensy tiny little detail that you can't go to your realm and so you can't summon me from your gallery." Desire twisted their blood-red lips into a mockery of pity. "I don't think it has even been a full 24 hours, and for you and me that is beyond _nothing_, half of a thousandth of a blink. I wanted to point that out so you know that whatever sort of bargaining for your throne you are about to do, it _will_ be pathetic and will be more begging than bargaining." Desire made a "you have the floor" gesture.

"**No amount of time during which my creations are suffering without me can be considered short.**"

"He's not here," Hob answered Lucienne's unasked question. "He can't be here, not yet. He's off..." He did a quick mental calculation of how much he should worry Lucienne. "He's off doing his own thing. You only have little old me, for now."

Lucienne looked ashamed to have been caught. "Of course. I understand. I just thought that the next time we saw you would be with him, when he came back."

Hob didn't want— didn't have _time_ to get angry at his allies. "Look, he _wants_ to come back. He's risking everything to come back. When I said he was off doing his own thing, I didn't mean he was getting mai tais in Cancún, I meant—"

"No, no, no, you misunderstand me," Lucienne interjected while waving her hands in front of herself. "I am not upset, it's a good thing. Well, I _am_ upset that he's gone and it is not good that he has lost his throne, I—" She was getting quite flustered, and took a deep breath before continuing in a calmer voice. "I am surprised that he sent you here when he cannot be here, too, to... what is the term humans use? "micromanage". I am surprised that he is off doing "his own thing"." She smiled at Hob, that small, warm smile that feels like a seal of approval. "You are good for him, Robert."

"Of course, of course, those poor things." Desire began walking around Dream. "You've been very busy, spending every second working on ways to help them." They stopped their pacing. "Even having sex with your knight to make sure morale stays high." Dream opened his mouth to retort, but Desire seized him by the chin, their claw-like nails digging into his cheeks. "You stink of it, brother. Of _him_."

Hob shifted awkwardly. A part of him wanted to retort that no, he'd never be good enough, not for Dream, not for anyone, all he could do is keep trying and trying to help him or anyone that needed him. However, his last conversation with Dream was still fresh enough that it helped him push that voice down. He wasn't quite ready to sing his own praises either, though. "You can call me Hob," was what he settled on replying.

Dream shoved Desire away, feeling the stinging trail their nails left on their wake. "**Don't try to draw me into a fight. It will not work. I know what you've done, my sibling, and I am giving you a chance to make things right without Destiny having to intercede.**"

"Oh, you _know_ what I've done?" Desire laughed. "You keep saying that, dearie." They put their hands on their hips and furrowed their brow exaggeratedly. ""**I know you helped Luci.**" "**I know you were in my realm.**" "**I know you took my boyfriend.**" "**I'm going to tell on you.**" Dream, honey, you have _jack fucking shit_. Sure, I made some jokes about puppeteering the Lightbringer and sneaking in through your back door, but did I really? Sure, I thought Robbie really completed the decor, but did _I_ take him? He's just a human, he's free for grabs, and for all you know, he could've been delivered to my doorstep—"

"**—by a demon from the Second Circle who could access both my realm and yours, who was put on this task by the Morningstar, but never took their prize back to Hell. For all I know. And I know this and plenty more. You were a fool to intercede in Hell's affairs and undermine their ruler, Desire. There are some watchful demons, you should know this.**"

"Yeah, I'm going to stick with Rob," Matthew interceded. "Y'know, like a normal person. And as your new boss, I have to tell you that you're late for your shift. I'm not running a resort here, Rob."

Hob met Lucienne's eye, who shrugged in a "let him have this" way, so Hob materialized his armor and longsword and saluted. "Aye, aye, sir. The usual?"

"The _ush_, yeah, the ol' slice and dice."

Desire's expression darkened as Dream spoke. "Those little gossips and their voyeur master," they spat. "I really do hate his whole Big Brother Is Watching routine, we have enough of that in our family."

Dream grinned with malice. "**I think that is precisely why Destiny respects his testimony, if he were ever to hear it.**" It was Dream now who grabbed Desire by the face, making sure that pitch black talons dug into powdered cheeks. "**So what now?**"

"I'm going to kill you someday."

Dream cocked his head to the side. "**Just that? Without a scheme, without a smile, without bravado?**" Holding Desire in place, he pressed a kiss to their forehead. "**Call in the Morningstar, little one.**"

## Chapter 20

It really was a powerful thing, to ride into battle with a raven on his shoulder.

Hob willed himself to disappear from the castle and off he went. He was proud at first of his growing grasp on the workings of the Dreaming, but with a pang of guilt and pain, he wondered if it was just because Dream wasn't around to keep a hand on the reins of his creation. There _was_ a feeling of wildness in the air. Angry, vengeful wildness of creatures who were without their King and did not care for it one bit.

Night Mare materialized next to Hob immediately, tossing her head and snorting. "Oh, I've missed you, too, girl," he said, patting her head. As he mounted, Matthew swooped down from the sky, circling above his head until he deemed his shoulder stable enough to land. That, too, was a first.

"It's gotten messier while you've been gone," the raven said.

Hob scowled, remembering how it had pained Dream to feel the battle continue far from his reach. "I imagine." They were in the outskirts of the active battlefield, and it was way closer to the castle than he remembered. All around him, wounded nightmares were being ushered to safety by dreams, who were also in charge of the makeshift med stations. The treatments administered were bizarre in the tamest cases, and made Hob's head hurt just by looking at them in the worst ones. "This wasn't here before," he said as Night Mare trotted around the various stations.

"Dream did most of it before," Matthew replied in a voice that seemed too soft to be able to come from a raven.

"Oh." Hob stared at a nightmare made entirely from flesh whose demon-induced damage appeared to be getting partially melted, and the treatment for that was apparently cutting new wounds in haphazard order and getting stitches placed where stitches weren't needed. Huh. Hob shook his head and turned Night Mare away and towards the enemy front. "The ol' slice and dice. Let's go."

---

"I don't think I'm supposed to be all the way out here." Lucifer's smirk showed just how much they were worried about where they should and shouldn't be.

"You're with us," Dream said, and at the exact same moment, Desire said, "You're with me." The eyes of both Endless met, and Desire's murderous intent increased tenfold.

It was dangerous indeed for the three of them to be standing in the old theater. Dream could feel it start to disconnect from the Earth, unable to keep existing in the mortal plane while containing their combined essences. It didn't matter. This was going to be quick.

Lucifer nodded, glancing between the siblings with an icy smile. "Desire, your summons surprised me. Are you here to mediate? This cannot possibly be a formal conference. The current leader of the Dreaming isn't present."

"I've reinstated myself as King, effective immediately," Dream replied curtly. "And I am here to accept your surrender."

The facade broke momentarily. The Morningstar turned to Desire, a puppet asking its master to direct its next movements. "_My_ surrender? I'm sorry, am _I_ the one with a fractured government, who is losing ground by the second?"

Desire, of course, swooped in before Dream said something that would humiliate them alongside the Lightbringer. "Sweetkins, this just isn't working anymore, our goals are no longer aligned, I'm afraid I have to let you go, I wish you luck in all your future endeavors, so on and so forth."

Lucifer's smile vanished. "So I no longer have your sponsorship. This means nothing. I will not surrender."

"You will, though. I kinda need you to. I don't like unfinished projects running around with my stamp of approval." Desire scrunched their nose, as if imagining the resulting inconvenience.

Lucifer's entire composure vanished. "I will _not_ be addressed like a... a... a _pet project_. I am not commanded—"

"But you are," Dream interrupted, tiring of his sibling mincing words to distance themselves from the defeat. "I told you so in Hell, you are commanded by your dreams of vengeance and freedom." It felt like swallowing a piece of rotten fruit, but he added, "And by your desires."

Desire startled at these last words but then, also seeming like they were trying to swallow something bitter, agreed. "You want to invade the Dreaming as a stepping stone to get back to Heaven. That desire, as strong as a homing beacon, is what drew me to you."

"And this is enough to make me humiliate myself by ordering an unexplained retreat?" Lucifer demanded.

Desire just shrugged, but Dream was trying to start to live his life without making the same mistakes over and over again. "What was said here is only known to us three. Neither of you have it in your best interest to let it to be known by others, and I, personally, see no point in doing so. As it has been pointed out to me," Dream glanced at Desire, "the short amount of time in which I requested an audience after being forced to resign does not shine a very flattering light over me. The gossip that will surely spread will make sure to point that out, too. Whatever it will say about you, Lightbringer, will not be worse than what is already being said of your involvement with my sibling, I'm certain of it. I did you a favor by not doing this in your realm."

The Morningstar paused, considering Dream's words. "And if I refuse?" they finally asked.

Dream turned to Desire. His sibling's smile was wide, wider than any human could physically achieve. "You don't want to know how my family takes a breach of contract," Desire said.

With their fists clenched and trembling, Lucifer tried for a smile again. "I'll give the order for a ceasefire, then. I look forward to any other future arrangements with any of your esteemed persons."

Once it was just the two of them, Desire looked at Dream and shuddered. "Ugh. Ew. Ugh. Agreeing with you—" They gagged. "Hated it. Fuck you. See you at the next family dinner."

And Dream was alone on the rundown stage.
