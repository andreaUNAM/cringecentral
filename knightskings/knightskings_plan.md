- Aw everything is sweet they reunited they are meeting like once a MONTH? WOW? This is great
  - This first point alone is now four chapters, 5k words..... help........
  - I haven't decided whether they get together here or latter
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ARE AT WAR. WITH _LUCIFER_.
  - it's none of your concern
  - IT'S ALL OF MY CONCERN
  - well sucks to be you you can't do anything about it
  - OH YEAH? WATCH THIS //falls asleep//
  - (also Hob smokes while in distressing situations like, for example, finding out Lucifer Morningstar exist when you're just a medieval peasant)
- everything you have everything you are you've got to give on the battlefield when everything is chaos and you have nothing but the way you feel your strategy and a sword you just think about the life you'll have together after the war [...] when you live for someone you're prepared to die deep down i know that im just a human but i know that i can draw my sword and fight with my short existence i can make a difference i can be there for him i can be his knight
- my lord there is a human dreamer kicking demon ass. Like... he's helping. But.... you know...... what the fuck..........
- Dream honey you make it so so so easy! I always go for the heart :)
- Option a, your human lives, luci leaves you alone (yes you do i own you bitch) and you keep ruling the dreaming buuuuuuuuuuuut you serve me and despair now :)))) or option b, your human dies and hell takes over the dreaming
  - how about option c where i step down, my humiliation makes you go home happy and free Hob, and Loosh kicks hells ass.
    - stupid little man makes a stupid little gamble
    - "My pride has hurt you once before. I will not repeat that mistake."
- sad little wet cat takes his human home, more at 10
  - Of course he can still feel everything that happens in the dreaming
    - Eg. Loosh finally cursing her ex-boss's stupid ass
  - Hob calls in "family emergency" @ school to make sure sad little wet cat is ok (he's not)
- [ Maybe the Death snippet goes here before she comes in to help ]
  - (when Death shows up, Hob has a moment of gentleman-y panic because here's the older sister. and here he is. with her brother. alone in his private chambers. hand on his thigh. _and they are not even engaged to be wed_. Scandalous.)
- Like i know this is technically not finished give me a fucking break ok
- Also eventually a Constantine scene. Cause that would be funny.

OKAY PART TWO LET'S GO WE CAN DO THIS

- Here's what we know:
  - Desire sneaked around the edges of the Dreaming, not quite entering so not quite breaking ancient laws
    - That's why they had to draw Hob out a little bit
    - The siren â†’ demon? so that they REALLY didn't break laws up until Hob crossed A Line
  - Desire has Luci by the short n curlies cause what is that bitchass angel but pure longing and desire for what once was, for power, for returning home, this time as a victor, not a fucken loser
    - But wait! That's a dream, in a sense! Luci can get puppeteered by any Endless, I really have not outgrown the habit of treating them as my personal punchingbag huh
- Dream knows that there is something sus with Desire's involvement with Hell, might need a person (demon) on the inside to tell him what's the sitch
  - How do you get a demon to spill the beans? Well, with an exorcist, of course!
  - Jo! Jo! Jo! Jo! Jo! and the crowd (except Hob) goes wild!!!!!!
  - (I'm the entire crowd tbh)
- Do I want to drag out the search and interrogation or does is this little demon ready to tattle?
  - If Luci has been somewhat publicly dragged around by Desire, I think a demon might turn on them because CRINGE! BOSS IS A LOSER!
    - (Speaking of loser bosses, dreams and nightmares need to unionize. this is completely unrelated to the fic.)
  - From demon A it's some fingerpointing to demon B (siren) (without needing to go to hell PLEASE, Hob would go if Dream went AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO GO)
    - (I'm going to end up sending them to hell, ain't I?)
  - LUCI WHAT THE _FUCK_ DID I SAY ABOUT NOT GIVING A SHIT ABOUT YOU
- something something desire showdown
- epilogue
