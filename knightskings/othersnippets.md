-- A quiet moment, somewhere, somewhen --

Dream didn't need to breathe, but he was doing it anyways. Maybe it was for Hob's sake, maybe he just enjoyed the experience. Each puff of air that left his nose rustled the thick brown hairs next to his head where it was pillowed on Hob's chest. With one elegant finger, he traced patterns on Hob's abdomen, which twitched occasionally when Dream touched a particularly ticklish spot. Hob, for his part, ran his hand up and down Dream's spine. He could feel it even through the silk robe (black, obviously) Dream was wearing; he needed to reiterate his offer of venison pasties, get some fat on those bones.

"All those years," he mused out loud, "and we didn't do this sooner. I mean, I don't know about you, but I've loved you... well, for a while now."

More than seeing it, he felt Dream's smile against his chest. "**I fell in love with you in the year 1689.**"

Hob's laugh rumbled deep within him. "Oh, you absolute _ass_."

Dream immediately rolled off him and lifted himself up on his forearms to stare right into Hob's soul through his eyes like he was so fond of doing. "**I am not joking.**"

Hob frowned. "Love, I was..." He gestured vaguely with the hand that had not remained stubbornly glued to Dream's back despite the shift in position. "I looked and smelled like the rancid turd of a seasick possum."

Dream rolled his eyes in a way that was adorably human. "**Thank you for that lovely image.**" The robe began slipping off one shoulder, and as a knee-jerk reaction, Hob grabbed the collar and pulled it back up. When he released it, Dream caught his hand and laced their fingers together. "**But I mean it. 1689. The year I began loving you.**"

"But..."

Dream, the petulant brat, put his free hand over Hob's mouth. No talking during the King's speech, okay. "**I realized I cared about you beyond an... _experiment_ between my sister and I when you told me of the horrors you had gone through. I was certain that that was it, that you were going to request my sister's gift, and it hurt. Deeply. To think of all you had suffered, to think that you had given up, to think...**" His voice got smaller. "**To think I'd lose you.**" He paused, tears beginning to gather in his eyes, and Hob squeezed his hand to bring him back to the present. He had seen tears like that on that day, but he had chalked it up to a trick of the light. No lord cries for a beggar. "**And then,**" Dream continued, "**you told me I was crazy for even asking that. You said you had so much to live for, and the hope in your eyes... It was so bright, I thought myself blinded by it. And in that moment, I knew I loved you. And I've loved you ever since.**"

Not being able to say anything in response, Hob simply kissed the hand over his mouth. Dream conceded and removed his hand, not without dragging Hob's bottom lip down while he did so. Hob smirked. "If you had asked me to guess, I would've honestly said 1789, judging by that look you gave me."

Dream chuckled, "**Ah, yes. 1789. I did want to do some unspeakable things to you in that moment, I'll admit.**"

Hob chased the hand that had just been removed to kiss it further, tips of fingers, palm, pulse point. "Why didn't you, then?" He regretted his words when all playful mirth vanished from Dream's eyes.

"**Like I said before, I was scared. Attachments of the Endless to mortals... dangerous things. And you may not be mortal, but you are human, and Destiny's rules are often muddled and two-faced.**" He tried a small smile, but Hob could tell it was forced. "**And then there's my pride.**"

"Ah. The third person in this relationship." He got a sharp poke to the gut for that, but it was worth it because Dream's smile was now genuine. "You didn't ask, but as for me: 1389. The moment I first saw you, you weird posh boy with a disgrace for a haircut who would've gotten his throat slit for that stupid ruby of yours, had you been human."

"**Really? It was that easy?**"

"Shut up," Hob grumbled. "And to be honest, I thought all you wanted was to have me on my knees behind the tavern, and that all that "_in a hundred years time_" shit was the poor excuse for flirting you had picked up in whatever castle you had crawled out of for the first time in your life. I watched you leave and waited a respectable amount of time to pretend we weren't leaving together, but when I got outside, poof, gone. Very disappointing." He titled his head, considering. "And then I didn't die. Less disappointing."

-- Idk how she fits into the plot i just think it would be very funny --

Dream had led him to home in Central London. Hob almost crashed into him when he stopped in front of the door. He had been struggling to keep up with the other's determined strides, each of which seemed unnaturally longer than they should've been, even with those goddamn long legs of his. All of a sudden, he had stopped short and turned to look at Hob.

"Alright, mate, are youâ€”" He took a moment to regain his breath. "Are you going to tell me where we're going?"

"**I must warn you, Hob. The resemblance is uncanny, but she is a descendant, not the woman herself. She does not know you or know anything about your...**" A quick glance to the side, like he was James fucking Bond saying "eyes and ears everywhere" with a pointed look. "**..._longevity_.**"

"You have to know that's not a real answer, right?"

Dream ignored him and knocked sharply.

The sound of steps came from within, followed by "Coming, coming", then a clang as something toppled over, then "Ow, fuck, why is this in the fucking way?". And yeah, that voice. Hob knew that voice. From where did he know that voice?

The first thing she said when she opened the door was, "Oh. It's you," while staring straight at Dream.

The first thing Hob said when she opened the door was, "Jesus _fucking_ H. Christ."

Dream gave him a look that said, "I literally _just_ told you." She followed his gaze (and also the expletive, quite possibly) and regarded Hob with curiosity. "I'm sorry, have we met?"

Dream replied quickly for him, "**No, you haven't.**" Hob would've complained that he was perfectly capable of answering for himself, but in full honesty, he did not trust himself to say anything at the moment.

"Right..." The descendant-not-the-woman-herself-Hob-get-it-together eyed them both again for good measure. "Well, then. The name's Johanna Constantine, pleasure to meet you."

The name felt like the last fucking straw, and it took Hob a moment to gather his thoughts enough to remember how to introduce himself. Gadlen? Gads? Wait, no, he had given up on changing his name around for at least two centuries now. Ha. Ironic. "Robert Gadling. Pleasure is all mine," he said, trying and failing to keep the poison out of his voice.

If Constantine noticed, she showed no sign. "I better invite you inside before our mutual friend breaks in again." She threw a small smile at Dream like they were sharing an inside joke, and Hob was ecstatic to see that Dream did not react. Who did she think she was, calling Dream their "mutual friend", trying to have inside jokes with him? When she stepped back into her home, Hob made sure to walk in behind her before Dream, keeping himself between the two at all times.

She walked ahead, saying this and that and "Sorry about the mess" (and Hob thought he was a hoarder). Hob ignored her. Instead, he leaned in closer to Dream and hissed, "The name's the fucking same."

"**I believe it is customary among humans to name their children after their ancestors as a sign of respect.**" Funny guy.

"Yeah, I know, I've got the same name as my "father" who gave me the money for the New Inn and as my "grandfather" who fought in World War II," Hob made the corresponding air quotes right in Dream's face to make sure his point wasn't lost. And to be a bitch. "And I also share an uncanny resemblance with both of them, but _guess fucking what_?!"

Dream didn't even have the decency of being annoyed at his gesticulations. "**If she were immortal and the same woman we faced in 1789, I'd know.**"

"I forgot you know everything, Your Lordship," Hob grumbled. He was starting to wish their night with this Constantine went similarly to the one with the other Constantine. He'd like to have something to punch.
