-- A quiet moment, somewhere, somewhen (now with a pre-moment) --

"**Can we have the conversation now?**"

They had been sitting in silence for almost two hours. After his sister left, Dream had closed his eyes and rested his chin on steepled fingers. In order to let him think or meditate or rest or whatever he needed to do in peace, Hob had grabbed a book he had left on the coffee table (a Portuguese novel around the Platonic cave myth). He didn't get very far in his reading; he kept glancing over to Dream, checking to see if he was alright, if he needed anything. It was after one of these side glances that Dream spoke. Hob didn't need to ask what conversation he was referring to.

"Duck, these are hardly peaceful times—"

"**There won't ever be such times, Hob,**" Dream growled and slammed his hands down on his lap, but Hob wasn't going to be dragged into his game.

"You very well know that I believe that there will be, and sooner than we expect," he answered calmly. "And all I want is for you not to be amidst some emotional turmoil when—"

"**I love you.**"

Hob opened his mouth, closed it, opened it again, and finally laughed softly, "When you do that." He could cry. He really could, any moment now, he could feel it rising up his chest like a balloon, but he was still laughing, and he could do both, they wouldn't be tears of sadness, anyway. "You know..." This time, his laugh really did have a sob caught somewhere in it. He ran a hand through his chin and the stubble gathering there since he hadn't shaved this morning. "I always thought I was going to be the first to say it."

Dream's smile was sharp, but there was warmth there, too. "**I win.**"

"You win. I love you."

"**I love you, too.**"

"I think we had already gone through that."

"**I know. I love you.**"

"You going for once for each century, dove?"

"**More like once for each second.**" Suddenly (and by suddenly he means _suddenly_, wisp-of-sand suddenly), Dream was no longer sitting next to him but towering in front of him. With a pale hand on his sternum, he pushed Hob down against the back of the couch and climbed onto his lap.

"Yeah, darling, that did _not_ count as the conversation. We need to talk like grown-ups about how we feel and how this is going to work, and I am going to hate myself for saying this but, Dream, could you please stop kissing my neck for two seconds and look at me?"

The reply was murmured against his pulse point. "**But I cannot kiss your lips because you won't stop talking.**" And then there was a shadow of teeth sinking in. Arrogant cunt.

In this angle, Hob could put his mouth right next to Dream's ear. "Look at me." Dream did so begrudgingly, and his eyes were not blue but black, completely so, except for the twinkle of stars within them. Awestruck, Hob traced a sharp cheekbone with his thumb, and then he met Dream halfway for a searing kiss.

Kissing Dream of the Endless, actually kissing him, not just brushing lips against his hand or nuzzling his neck or hugging him or holding him or squeezing his arm or his thigh, actually kissing him felt beyond what any human, mortal or not, should be allowed to experience. With everything he had dared to do before now, Hob could've fooled himself into thinking he was loving a man; a man whose body temperature ran a bit colder than average, sure, but a man. The chance to do that was no longer on the table. When Dream straddled his lap, Hob felt pinned to the spot, and yet Dream weighted nothing at all. He wasn't just light; there was no weight to him _at all_. And when he gasped and Hob used that chance to deepen the kiss, the inside of his mouth tasted like dozing off next to a cozy fireplace with a warm cup of tea in your hands. Not like the taste of the tea, or the lingering smell of the burning wood on your tongue. Like the experience itself, which should not be a taste to begin with. But it was, in Dream's mouth.

Hob wanted to know what the rest of him tasted like.

Dream didn't get the chance to complain about Hob breaking the kiss before Hob's mouth was latched onto his neck. Of course it didn't taste like skin; it tasted like a nap in a garden. Would it bruise? Hob was briefly reminded of the conversation he wanted to have that would include a discussion on boundaries (you don't go through six centuries worth of partners without learning that it's best to settle them first instead of running headfirst into them in the worst possible ways), but then Dream whined and dug his nails into his biceps. Okay, yeah, it could wait, right?

"**Hob...**" He felt his name vibrate through Dream's throat. "**I want...**"

"Yeah, love, me too. Bedroom?" _Centuries_ he had waited for this. It was _not_ happening on a shitty couch. He nudged at Dream's hips because he weighted nothing at all yet no force on Earth could've moved him if he didn't choose to be moved.

Dream kissed him as he slipped off his lap and stood up, forcing Hob to scramble to follow him up lest they stop touching for even a second (unforgivable sin). It was not the first time Hob blindly led someone towards his room, and yet he still managed to miss the door and ended up pressing Dream against the wall next to it. Oh, well. They could have a little pit stop here, no harm, no foul.

With the hand that wasn't cradling Dream's head, Hob began to push Dream's coat off his shoulders. When it fell to the floor and revealed the short-sleeved black tee underneath (bare arms, scandalous), Dream shivered. Hob smirked against his lips. Oh, he couldn't wait to break past the stoney façade and make him squirm.

The reaction had been so delicious that Hob now used both hands to catch the hem of the T-shirt and push it upwards. He had pushed up all the way up to Dream's chest before he noticed that not only had Dream stopped kissing him, but he was pressing himself back against the wall like he wanted to disappear into it, eyes scrunched up tight. It was definitely not an expression of ecstasy or anything close to it.

"Dream?" No response. "Dream?" Hob repeated, more insistent. He released the shirt and it fell over Dream's torso once again. That finally got his attention.

When Dream opened his eyes again, for a split second they were a thousand miles away, but then he seemed to remember where he was. "**I-I apologize. That was... It will not happen again.**" He surged forwards to kiss Hob again, but Hob dodged him.

"Dream, what just happened?"

He almost stormed out, Hob was sure of it. Hob would've gotten really pissed if he had, not because of his own current situation—which by now was a half-situation and was quickly becoming a no-situation—but because whatever Dream's current deal was was worrying him the fuck out of his mind. The old Dream would've stormed out. This Dream just considered the option very heavily.

"Please, talk to me."

"**I...**" Dream crossed his arms over his chest, and maybe it was the skinny arms and the rarity of only one layer of clothing, but once again he looked so painfully vulnerable. He had turned his head away from Hob. "**I have not been... without clothing... since I escaped from my imprisonment.**"

Hob saw red. He had never wanted to learn anything about Dream's imprisonment beyond what Dream shared freely, but pictures had formed in his mind, as minds sometimes do without permission. He had pictured some sort of twisted temple, fit for a being beyond godly divinity but a prison nonetheless. He had pictured a common prison, like many he had seen himself. He had _never_ pictured anywhere where the basic decency of clothing was not granted. Trying to be gentle despite the rage coursing through him (one of the Hobs of the past would've already put his fist through the wall, he knew better now, that would not help), he bent down to retrieve Dream's coat and wrapped it around his shoulders. "Say nothing more, sweeting. We don't have to do anything you don't want—"

"**But I _want_, Hob Gadling!**" Dream roughly shoved the coat off and grabbed Hob by the wrists. "**I. Want. _You_. Deeply. Ardently.**"

Hob had learned his lesson of the day about letting his dick do the thinking for him, which is the only reason why he didn't kiss Dream silly after hearing that. "You have me. And we can figure out a way for you to have me in any other way you want without risking your comfort."

Dream's grip on his wrists softened, and a pensive expression appeared on his features. After a moment of consideration, there was a whisper of shifting sands and Dream was no longer wearing his coat, shirt, jeans, or boots. Instead, he was wearing a silk robe. _Just_ a silk robe. It was black (obviously) and long enough to pool around Dream's feet. The tiny stars on it were embroidered with shimmering black thread, so they seemed to appear and disappear depending on how the light hit them. Or maybe they _were_ appearing and disappearing. "**Will this do?**"

Hob managed to speak despite his throat suddenly feeling completely dry. "You tell me, dove. Do you feel comfortable?"

To Hob's relief, Dream seemed to actually consider the question instead of just rushing through and ignoring his feelings like before. "**Yes. Yes, I do. As ridiculous as it sounds, I think that with this I can trick my body into feeling covered without it... getting in the way.**" As he said those last words, he gazed at Hob through lowered lashes, and Hob wanted to travel back in time just to tell his 1789 self that yes, that look he is giving you means exactly what you think it does, have your way with him on the tavern floor.

But alas, his 2022 self still had some talking left to do, as much as he wanted to shrug it off as a common turn of phrase. "It's not ridiculous, Dream. Whatever you need to do to feel okay, it is never ridiculous, like how I avoid bodies of water larger than a tub or how I always wash my face with warm water. If it stops the bad shit from popping up, it's not ridiculous. That's what my therapist told me." Dream's eyebrow rose with an unspoken question. "Yes, I have a therapist. Yes, I have to lie to him constantly. Yes, it still helps despite all the lying. Can we stop talking about him now?"

Dream started toying with the hem of Hob's shirt and smirked. "**Can we stop talking altogether?**"

"Are you okay?"

"**With you around, my knight?**" Dream threw his arms around Hob's neck. "**Always.**"

Dream's mouth now tasted like the sleep that welcomes you after a long day.

Dream didn't need to breathe, but he was doing it anyways. Maybe it was for Hob's sake, maybe he just enjoyed the experience. Each puff of air that left his nose rustled the thick brown hairs next to his head where it was pillowed on Hob's chest. With one elegant finger, he traced patterns on Hob's abdomen, which twitched occasionally when Dream touched a particularly ticklish spot. Hob, for his part, ran his hand up and down Dream's spine. He could feel it even through his robe; he needed to reiterate his offer of venison pasties, get some fat on those bones.

"All those years," he mused out loud, "and we didn't do this sooner. I mean, I don't know about you, but I've loved you... well, for a while now."

More than seeing it, he felt Dream's smile against his chest. "**I fell in love with you in the year 1689.**"

Hob's laugh rumbled deep within him. "Oh, you absolute _ass_."

Dream immediately rolled off him and lifted himself up on his forearms to stare right into Hob's soul through his eyes like he was so fond of doing. "**I am not joking.**"

Hob frowned. "Love, I was..." He gestured vaguely with the hand that had not remained stubbornly glued to Dream's back despite the shift in position. "I looked and smelled like the rancid turd of a seasick possum."

Dream rolled his eyes in a way that was adorably human. "**Thank you for that lovely image.**" The robe began slipping off one shoulder, and as a knee-jerk reaction, Hob grabbed the collar and pulled it back up. When he released it, Dream caught his hand and laced their fingers together. "**But I mean it. 1689. The year I began loving you.**"

"But..."

Dream, the petulant brat, put his free hand over Hob's mouth. No talking during the King's speech, okay. "**I realized I cared about you beyond an... _experiment_ between my sister and I when you told me of the horrors you had gone through. I was certain that that was it, that you were going to request my sister's gift, and it hurt. Deeply. To think of all you had suffered, to think that you had given up, to think...**" His voice got smaller. "**To think I'd lose you.**" He paused, tears beginning to gather in his eyes, and Hob squeezed his hand to bring him back to the present. He had seen tears like that on that day, but he had chalked it up to a trick of the light. No lord cries for a beggar. "**And then,**" Dream continued, "**you told me I was crazy for even asking that. You said you had so much to live for, and the hope in your eyes... It was so bright, I thought myself blinded by it. And in that moment, I knew I loved you. And I've loved you ever since.**"

Not being able to say anything in response, Hob simply kissed the hand over his mouth. Dream conceded and removed his hand, not without dragging Hob's bottom lip down while he did so. Hob smirked. "If you had asked me to guess, I would've honestly said 1789, judging by that look you gave me."

Dream chuckled, "**Ah, yes. 1789. I did want to do some unspeakable things to you in that moment, I'll admit.**"

Hob chased the hand that had just been removed to kiss it further, tips of fingers, palm, pulse point. "Why didn't you, then?" He regretted his words when all playful mirth vanished from Dream's eyes.

"**Like I said before, I was scared. Attachments of the Endless to mortals... dangerous things. And you may not be mortal, but you are human, and Destiny's rules are often muddled and two-faced.**" He tried a small smile, but Hob could tell it was forced. "**And then there's my pride.**"

"Ah. The third person in this relationship." He got a sharp poke to the gut for that, but it was worth it because Dream's smile was now genuine. "You didn't ask, but as for me: 1389. The moment I first saw you, you weird posh boy with a disgrace for a haircut who would've gotten his throat slit for that stupid ruby of yours, had you been human."

"**Really? It was that easy?**"

"Shut up," Hob grumbled. "And to be honest, I thought all you wanted was to have me on my knees behind the tavern, and that all that "_in a hundred years time_" shit was the poor excuse for flirting you had picked up in whatever castle you had crawled out of for the first time in your life. I watched you leave and waited a respectable amount of time to pretend we weren't leaving together, but when I got outside, poof, gone. Very disappointing." He titled his head, considering. "And then I didn't die. Less disappointing."

Dream buried his hand in Hob's hair. "**Must you always be so crude?**"

Leaning into the touch, Hob murmured, "You didn't mind me being crude half an hour ago."

It was now Dream's turn to grumble, "**Shut up,**" adding a tug to Hob's hair, but the warning was overshadowed by the dusty blush that rose to his cheeks.

"C'mere," Hob laughed, twisting his leg to pull Dream back down. Not done being a brat for the day, Dream let himself fall like a puppet whose strings had been cut and landed on Hob's chest. After placing a soft kiss on his forehead, Hob placed two fingers under his chin and gently lifted his head so they were eye to eye. "_Myne owne hertis rote_," he whispered and greedily devoured the spark of adoration that appeared in Dream's eyes.

-- Idk how she fits into the plot i just think it would be very funny --

Dream had led him to home in Central London. Hob almost crashed into him when he stopped in front of the door. He had been struggling to keep up with the other's determined strides, each of which seemed unnaturally longer than they should've been, even with those goddamn long legs of his. All of a sudden, he had stopped short and turned to look at Hob.

"Alright, mate, are you—" He took a moment to regain his breath. "Are you going to tell me where we're going?"

"**I must warn you, Hob. The resemblance is uncanny, but she is a descendant, not the woman herself. She does not know you or know anything about your...**" A quick glance to the side, like he was James fucking Bond saying "eyes and ears everywhere" with a pointed look. "**..._longevity_.**"

"You have to know that's not a real answer, right?"

Dream ignored him and knocked sharply.

The sound of steps came from within, followed by "Coming, coming", then a clang as something toppled over, then "Ow, fuck, why is this in the fucking way?". And yeah, that voice. Hob knew that voice. From where did he know that voice?

The first thing she said when she opened the door was, "Oh. It's you," while staring straight at Dream.

The first thing Hob said when she opened the door was, "Jesus _fucking_ H. Christ."

Dream gave him a look that said, "I literally _just_ told you." She followed his gaze (and also the expletive, quite possibly) and regarded Hob with curiosity. "I'm sorry, have we met?"

Dream replied quickly for him, "**No, you haven't.**" Hob would've complained that he was perfectly capable of answering for himself, but in full honesty, he did not trust himself to say anything at the moment.

"Right..." The descendant-not-the-woman-herself-Hob-get-it-together eyed them both again for good measure. "Well, then. The name's Johanna Constantine, pleasure to meet you."

The name felt like the last fucking straw, and it took Hob a moment to gather his thoughts enough to remember how to introduce himself. Gadlen? Gads? Wait, no, he had given up on changing his name around for at least two centuries now. Ha. Ironic. "Robert Gadling. Pleasure is all mine," he said, trying and failing to keep the poison out of his voice.

If Constantine noticed, she showed no sign. "I better invite you inside before our mutual friend breaks in again." She threw a small smile at Dream like they were sharing an inside joke, and Hob was ecstatic to see that Dream did not react. Who did she think she was, calling Dream their "mutual friend", trying to have inside jokes with him? When she stepped back into her home, Hob made sure to walk in behind her before Dream, keeping himself between the two at all times.

She walked ahead, saying this and that and "Sorry about the mess" (and Hob thought he was a hoarder). Hob ignored her. Instead, he leaned in closer to Dream and hissed, "The name's the fucking same."

"**I believe it is customary among humans to name their children after their ancestors as a sign of respect.**" Funny guy.

"Yeah, I know, I've got the same name as my "father" who gave me the money for the New Inn and as my "grandfather" who fought in World War II," Hob made the corresponding air quotes right in Dream's face to make sure his point wasn't lost. And to be a bitch. "And I also share an uncanny resemblance with both of them, but _guess fucking what_?!"

Dream didn't even have the decency of being annoyed at his gesticulations. "**If she were immortal and the same woman we faced in 1789, I'd know.**"

"I forgot you know everything, Your Lordship," Hob grumbled. He was starting to wish their night with this Constantine went similarly to the one with the other Constantine. He'd like to have something to punch.
