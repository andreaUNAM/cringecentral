## Epilogue

Hob was reading a book of fables. It was moralistic to the point of provoking nausea, and there were quite a few print errors. He knew where each of these errors were because he had set this book himself. That was one of the many, _many_ wonders of spending time in the Dreaming's library. He could find any of the books he had printed and touch them and read them and enjoy them (or criticize their poorly disguised indoctrinations) without them crumbling to dust in his fingers.

Ego was only part of the reason. He _was_ very proud of what he had accomplished, but there was more to it. It was remembering a time when he had clawed his way out of illiteracy whenever his master read to him the page he was setting. It was chuckling at a particular print error with an amusing anecdote behind it. It was revisiting a text with new eyes, eyes that he dared called eyes of a scholar (grad school had been enough of a torment, he could allow himself that title when he was feeling generous). Okay. Ego was the entire reason.

He had seen Dream arrive out of the corner of his eye and had smiled as a greeting when he took the chair next to his. They did this often enough in Hob's dreams; they'd sit side by side in comfortable silence, each of them working on their own thing. Hob would read for pleasure or work on his lectures (the amount of bibliography at hand made it very comfortable). Dream would often pour through thick tomes or lengthy scrolls that somehow related to his job in ways that Hob had given up trying to comprehend, but there were other times when he'd also read for pleasure, mostly things from the twentieth century onwards ("**I am the Prince of Stories, I need to catch up.**").

There was no need to exchange pleasantries or set aside books in fear of offending the other. Each other's presence was more than enough. Usually, when they did this, maybe they'd hook their pinkies together, grounding each other, and that was enough. But right now? Right now there was a hand that was not his own caressing his jaw.

"Can I help you?" he asked without lifting his eyes from the book even though he was no longer processing a single word.

Dream made a noncommittal sound. "**I'm just observing.**"

Hob looked at Dream and then pointedly flitted his gaze down towards his lover's wandering hand. "Right. _Just_ observing."

"**Hush.**" Dream pressed the pad of his thumb to Hob's lips. His expression was so soft and loving it made Hob's heart melt, and yet he still couldn't stop himself from being a tease.

"Here? My liege, your subjects might see us. The court rumors will go wild."

Dream tilted his thumb just so to add a slight bite from his nail. "**Do foolish rumors worry you, Sir Gadling?**" Oh, this was evolving from a joke into an interesting game.

Hob bit his cheek to stop himself from smiling. "Your reputation..." Even with his habit of speaking without thinking, his next words were carefully planned, laying a hidden bait. He needed to know. Curiosity kept his heart beating. "If we were at least engaged to be wed..."

"**Would that put you at ease and halt their insolent tongues? Then it shall be so.**" They were fooling around. Hob was being a tease and Dream was playing along. Nothing was being said in seriousness. Except for Hob's bait, which Dream had taken. In jest or in earnest, Hob didn't know. He swallowed, and hopefully Dream confused the gesture with one of arousal.

Dream removed his thumb with a flick to Hob's nose. Hob didn't want to go for low-hanging fruit in his descriptions, but Dream had the smile of the cat that got the cream. "**As long as the wedding never comes to be.**" His tone had remained the exact same shade of sultry. This was all a game to him.

A cold fist was squeezing Hob's heart, but he tried to keep the emotion from reaching his face. Sometimes you don't like what you catch when you set a trap; he had been a hunter enough times to know this. Later, he should probably bring it up again outside of any joke (communication was key and all that shit). Later. Now... What would he do next, if he were still playing Dream's game, unbothered? Chase after the thumb to take it into his mouth? Go for Dream's lips?

He hesitated for too long.

_And_ he had failed at keeping his hurt expression at bay.

Dream was staring at him like he was some complex mathematical problem. "**I've... upset you,**" he said uncertainly. He was doing his part in trying to decipher Hob's emotions; Hob should meet him halfway.

"Yes, you have, but you did nothing wrong," he answered, and he meant every word. "I set myself up with my own expectations, but I understand." He was picking at a hangnail on his index finger. Great. In his anxiety, he had dreamt up a hangnail. "A widower and a divorcé. We need to take things slow." Slow. They had been together for four years now, and had known each other for six hundred and thirty seven. But Hob was willing to take it as slow as Dream needed.

Hob could see the gears turning in Dream's head as he processed his words and the moment understanding dawned on his face. "**Oh, my dearest Hob,**" he whispered, and Hob wanted to brush off his pity, repeating that he understood, but then Dream cupped his face between his hands and pressed their foreheads together. "**Nothing would make me happier than to be married to you. My problem is with the wedding.**"

"The wedding?"

"**As an Endless and as Lord of the Dreaming, there are things expected of me, mostly in terms of the guest list. I'd have to invite my siblings, for starters. _All_ of them.**"

"Oh," was all Hob could say, feeling rather stupid. He knew about this sort of thing. He had _lived_ it. His and Eleanor's wedding had been more of a minefield of courtly manners and ill-intentioned guests than the rustic-barn-beach-fairy-lights-mason-jar stuff that sometimes popped up in his Pinterest feed (more so lately, which was quite suspicious).

"**I cannot even guess if The Prodigal would attend or not,**" Dream continued, separating himself from Hob, clearly getting lost in his musings. "**The rest, on the other hand, would attend without a doubt, and to give Desire a chance to sabotage me...**"

"Yeah, definitely, I—"

"**The old gods that have not faded away. The Kindly Ones. My wife and her sisters. An archangel or two. The Morningstar, too, would have to be invited.**"

This made Hob furrow his brow. "Isn't the war fresh enough to give you an excuse to skip that one?"

Dream shook his head. "**I wish, but it would be a great offense if we were to invite others and not them.**"

"Right. Like Maleficent in _Sleeping Beauty_, who's offended that out of all the Fair Folk—"

"**The Fair Folk! Titania... I cannot stand her.**"

"Okay, uh." Hob rubbed his eyes. "Putting aside for a moment that Titania is real and you _know_ her, love... I understand now." He took Dream's hand and traced circles into the palm in an attempt to calm him. "You don't need to keep making the guest list; we don't need a wedding. We don't need to be married. I love you. You love me. That is more than enough for me."

Dream's smile (combined with the fact that he had stopped listing beings) told Hob that he had successfully returned him back to the present moment. "**You're right. It is more than enough. As lovely as the added boon of a formal marriage might be, the wedding...**"

"...it sounds like a diplomatic nightmare, yeah."

"**I have created a few of those, if you want to meet them,**" Dream taunted, his smile growing sharp. He kept trying to teach Hob not to take words relating to his realm so lightly, but Hob kept forgetting his lessons.

"Thanks, beautiful, but I'm good," Hob laughed. "Let me rephrase: it sounds like a diplomatic pain in the arse. No wedding. We shall live in sin."

Dream seemed about to say something witty back, but then he looked pensive all of a sudden. "**Unless...**"

"Yes?" Hob prompted.

"**If our problem is that inviting one means inviting another, and so on and so forth until we exhaust all deities and spirits in this and other planes... If the guest list remained blank...**"

Hob felt the familiar tickle of adrenaline starting to pump through his veins. "Dear heart, are you suggesting we elope?"

The look Dream gave him was pure mischief. "**Are you willing, Sir Gadling? To take your King in marriage away from the prying eyes of society?**"

They were playing this game again, but now with clearer rules. Hob smirked. "My Lord, that you feel the need to ask offends me."

Dream pulled him into a kiss with such force that Hob's nose crashed painfully into his cheekbone.

In between kisses, Hob managed to ask, "We're doing it now, right?"

"**Now,**" Dream confirmed. Once again, he pressed his forehead to Hob's, his hands running up and down Hob's arms. So much movement; he was nervous.

"Fantastic. Do we need a witness?" Before he had finished his question, Hob already had his answer and he knew Dream was thinking of the exact same candidate. He could blame it on Dreaming magic making his thoughts more accesible, but in all honesty, there weren't a lot of options.

As Dream gave him one last kiss, Hob felt a familiar breeze blow in from behind him, announcing the appearance of an open door. "**I'll meet you in Fiddler's Green,**" Dream whispered against his lips before standing up and rushing away.

Lucienne paused with her quill halfway to the inkpot when she felt the unmistakable presence of Lord Morpheus. She put the quill down by her ledger and raised her head. "Yes, my Lord?" she inquired with a polite smile.

His expression was perfectly neutral apart from a regal jut of his chin. It was a perfectly normal expression for Lord Morpheus, but Lucienne could've sworn to have seen Robert Gadling in the library not too long ago, and that usually meant her King went around with a softer posture and small smiles. In his hand he held a thick tome—not as large as a book detailing a dreamer's life, mind you, but one that would be considered a lengthy read in the Waking World. He was holding it off to the side, where his coat fell over it, obscuring any further details.

"**Lucienne. There's a matter in Fiddler's Green that requires your attention.**" His voice was as neutral as his expression. This meant it was nothing of great concern, and Lucienne was getting accustomed to being explicitly called upon for matters of the kingdom. He had truly changed, and Lucienne would be lying if she said she wasn't proud of him.

She stood up and bowed her head minutely. "Very well, my Lord, lead the way."

---

Hob was standing under a gigantic ash tree and was pulling at a blade of grass he had plucked from the ground. He remembered the first time Dream had shown him Fiddler's Green. When his restless hands had inevitably pulled a daisy out of the ground, he had apologized profusely to Dream, to the dream, to the daisy, but Dream had explained (with a very amused expression) that he had committed no crime. Like all dreams, Fiddler's Green existed to serve the dreamers, be it to offer a tranquil moment under the shade of a tree, a flower to be picked, or, apparently, a blade of glass to twist between one's fingers while experiencing pre-nuptial jitters.

When Dream and Lucienne appeared, she seemed surprised to see him there, which made Hob wonder what reason Dream had given her to bring her here. "Robert," was her way of greeting him.

"Hob, I've told you. And, uh, hi." If this were the Waking World, his hands would already be clammy with sweat. God bless their choice of venue. His eyes met Dream's. "Hi," he repeated.

"**Hello,**" Dream answered with a hint of smile. He was still dressed in his usual attire, and Hob felt quite overdressed. Dream presented a book he was carrying to Lucienne. "**I believe you are going to need this.**"

When the librarian received the volume and opened it to the title page, her usually controlled demeanor failed her. "Sir, this is a _Bible_," she choked out. Hob craned his neck to see for himself. Huh, so it was. And not any Bible, the King James Version, Barker's original print.

"**I am aware, Lucienne.**" When Dream spoke, Lucienne and Hob turned to look at him simultaneously. Out of the corner of his eye, Hob saw Lucienne's mouth fall open, and he knew that whatever face _he_ was making was a billion times more embarrassing. Hob was definitely not overdressed; he might even be _underdressed_. Dream was wearing a sheer organza blouse with bell sleeves fitted at the wrist and neck with black ribbons (and yes, the time Hob had spent behind the counter of a haberdasher between the World Wars was paying off, allowing him to truly appreciate what he was looking at). The fabric shimmered with blues and blacks over the canvas that was Dream's ivory torso. His black slacks were so perfectly fitted, they might as well have been painted on. Hob missed the familiar presence of the Doc Martens, but he had to admit the black ankle boots fit quite nicely. To top it all off, a magnificent cape billowed around him, long enough to trail behind him. A wedding train, of sorts. It was black in a way that no physical object on Earth could be black, devouring all light around it, and emitting its own light in the form of thousands of stars. "**It is traditional to have some form of sacred text, and I thought that the most fitting choice would be to stick to the tradition Hob is familiar with.**" As he spoke, he elegantly adjusted his ribboned cuffs despite them needing no adjustments, but it so happened that the gesture drew even more attention to his appearance. What an overgrown, goth _peacock_ he was.

Lucienne's eyes moved between the two of them as she drew her conclusions of what exactly was going on here, calculated the diplomatic disaster her King was about to unleash on their realm (and mostly on her), and decided in what way to proceed. Hob would understand if she felt the need to yell at Dream for a bit, but he hoped that eventually she'd get on with officiating the wedding. "Well... At least _that_ explains _that_." She pushed her glasses up her nose as she gave Hob a once-over.

Now Hob was the one with two pairs of eyes on him and on his outfit. He chuckled and spread his arms. "Yeah, uh, this just sort of happened. I _am_ fond of suits, I must say. They fit very nicely, make you look posh in a pinch, and there's not as many layers as there used to be. Three, four, tops. Nothing like before. It's nice to have something, well, _nice_ to wear that you can put on yourself without needing a valet." And it was a _very_ nice suit. The worsted wool of the jacket and pants was a rich, dark golden and smooth like butter to the touch. The Royal Oxford shirt was a paler shade of gold, almost to be confused with white except for the occasional glint in the Fiddler's Green sun.

"And kids these days that complain about how wearing a tie is suffocating have clearly never worn a cravat." The silk necktie in question, also golden, was held in place by a tie pin depicting an anchor with a tiny ruby on the head. This was the only part of his attire that existed in the Waking World; it had been a gift during a faculty Christmas party, nothing really significant, but he guessed it had been brought forth into the Dreaming because of the gem.

"And, uh, then there's this, which is very, um, _you_, I must say." Unaccustomed to such a garment, Hob self-consciously swished from side to side to show off his cape. He had worn capes in the past, of course, but those had been much more sober and most definitely made out of _fabric_. This one? Hob would bet good money it was made of pure golden light and his hand would go right through it if he tried (he was too nervous to try). The pattern—a patchwork of tiles with geometric figures like mosaics in a mosque—refused to stay put, floating around the general area of the cape and shifting around. "Thanks, I love it, and I never would've thought of something like it on my own."

In times when Dream looked at him like he was doing right now, with unfiltered adoration, Hob couldn't help but think that this was truly a wonder of a universe they lived in, one where an Endless looked at a common man like that. "**I did not dress you, Hob,**" Dream explained. "**You _did_ think of something like that on your own, and I must say, it's exquisite.**"

"_You're_ exquisite," Hob retorted, and Dream chuckled.

"**I believe our witness is going to leave us to tend to her duties if we do not hurry.**" Dream presented his hands and Hob took them reverently, taking his place in front of his groom.

Lucienne, in turn, took her place between them, Bible pressed to her chest. There were tears starting to gather in her eyes, but her voice remained firm. "There is nothing more important to me in this moment, my Lords, but I do understand matters of secrecy such as this tend to be hurried as a precaution." When she said "secrecy", the ash tree over them began to change. Its leaves became longer and thinner and its branches curved downwards until the three of them were standing under the cover of a weeping willow.

Dream smiled at their sudden privacy, unnecessary as it was, for no creature of the Dreaming would intrude if their Lord did not want them to, and all creatures of the Dreaming would soon learn of the happy occasion through the joy of their Lord. "**Thank you, Gilbert,**" he murmured, and Hob, ever-curious, never-sated, wondered who that could be. Some sort of dryad inhabiting the tree? The tree itself? A single leaf on the weeping willow? He wasn't going to ask, though, not now. Why would he? He had an eternity stretching before him to learn everything he could every want about his soon-to-be-husband and his creations.

"If I may, how long have you been planning to do this?" Lucienne asked.

Without taking his eyes off Dream (would he ever be able to look at anything else in his life?), Hob replied, "To elope? About twenty minutes, Dreaming time. To spend as much time as I am allowed with this wonderful creature until the end of times?" He squeezed Dream's hands. "Quite a while, if I'm honest." For a moment, Dream looked like he was struggling to find something to say in return, but Hob gave his hands another squeeze to tell him it wasn't necessary if he didn't want to. Between him and his Stranger, he had always been the talker.

Lucienne dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief she pulled from her sleeves and cleared her throat. "Well. I am glad this is not something I was asked to prepare in advance. I would've spent ages going through every wedding speech that has ever been written and every love letter that has ever been sent, but I wouldn't have been satisfied. I can say now, in the clarity that only comes from the spontaneous, that that would've been a fool's errand. I do not need the words of poets or rhetoricians or lovers; I only need my own."

"I am, undeniably, a part of my Lord. It would not suffice, however, to say that what he loves, we love. Each one of us experiences that connection differently. I have come to know and love Robert Gadling on my own volition. I know him to be a great man, worthy of admiration and respect of both humans and creatures of the Dreaming alike. He is a man I am more than happy to join in marriage to a being that I love for reasons that have nothing to do with the circumstances of my creation. Sir Gadling." She paused. "Hob, I have no doubt in my heart that you care about him as much as I do. He is safe in your hands. Lord Morpheus, we needn't concern ourselves with fears from our past. The future is bright in this new age."

She looked down at the Bible in her hand, caressing the cover. "I was also given the task of bringing some tradition into this affair, but I do not know how to do so. Death will not do you part. In fact, she has been endeavoring to do quite the opposite since the very start of your relationship." Hob let out a hearty laugh and Dream's already wide smile widened another millimeter (most definitely reaching a new personal record). "I cannot join your lives like humans join theirs, nor can I turn to rituals conducted by gods or fae. Your union is novel and unique, and I am honored to have been chosen for the task."

"All that remains for me to say is: by the power vested in me by you, my Lord, I am thrilled to pronounce you King and Prince Consort of the Dreaming."

Kissing Dream of the Endless when one could also call him one's husband was beyond what any human, mortal or not, should be able to accomplish.

Hob Gadling enjoyed being a human that tested the limits.
