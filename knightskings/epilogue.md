## Epilogue

Hob was reading a book of fables. It was moralistic to the point of provoking nausea, and there were quite a few print errors. He knew where each of these errors were because he had set this book himself. That was one of the many, _many_ wonders of spending time in the Dreaming's library. He could find any of the books he had printed and touch them and read them and enjoy them (or criticize their poorly disguised indoctrinations) without them crumbling to dust in his fingers.

Ego was only part of the reason. He _was_ very proud of what he had accomplished, but there was more to it. It was remembering a time when he had clawed his way out of illiteracy whenever his master read to him the page he was setting. It was chuckling at a particular print error with an amusing anecdote behind it. It was revisiting a text with new eyes, eyes that he dared called eyes of a scholar (grad school had been enough of a torment, he could allow himself that title when he was feeling generous). Okay. Ego was the entire reason.

He had seen Dream arrive out of the corner of his eye and had smiled as a greeting when he took the chair next to his. They did this often enough in Hob's dreams; they'd sit side by side in comfortable silence, each of them working on their own thing. Hob would read for pleasure or work on his lectures (the amount of bibliography at hand made it very comfortable). Dream would often pour through thick tomes or lengthy scrolls that somehow related to his job in ways that Hob had given up trying to comprehend, but there were other times when he'd also read for pleasure, mostly things from the twentieth century onwards ("**I am the Prince of Stories, I need to catch up.**").

There was no need to exchange pleasantries or set aside books in fear of offending the other. Each other's presence was more than enough. Usually, when they did this, maybe they'd hook their pinkies together, grounding each other, and that was enough. But right now? Right now there was a hand that was not his own caressing his jaw.

"Can I help you?" he asked without lifting his eyes from the book even though he was no longer processing a single word.

Dream made a noncommittal sound. "**I'm just observing.**"

Hob looked at Dream and then pointedly flitted his gaze down towards his lover's wandering hand. "Right. _Just_ observing."

"**Hush.**" Dream pressed the pad of his thumb to Hob's lips. His expression was so soft and loving it made Hob's heart melt, and yet he still couldn't stop himself from being a tease.

"Here? My liege, your subjects might see us. The court rumors will go wild."

Dream tilted his thumb just so to add a slight bite from his nail. "**Do foolish rumors worry you, Sir Gadling?**" Oh, this was evolving from a joke into an interesting game.

Hob bit his cheek to stop himself from smiling. "Your reputation..." Even with his habit of speaking without thinking, his next words were carefully planned, laying a hidden bait. He needed to know. Curiosity kept his heart beating. "If we were at least engaged to be wed..."

"**Would that put you at ease and halt their insolent tongues? Then it shall be so.**" They were fooling around. Hob was being a tease and Dream was playing along. Nothing was being said in seriousness. Except for Hob's bait, which Dream had taken. In jest or in earnest, Hob didn't know. He swallowed, and hopefully Dream confused the gesture with one of arousal.

Dream removed his thumb with a flick to Hob's nose. Hob didn't want to go for low-hanging fruit in his descriptions, but Dream had the smile of the cat that got the cream. "**As long as the wedding never comes to be.**" His tone had remained the exact same shade of sultry. This was all a game to him.

A cold fist was squeezing Hob's heart, but he tried to keep the emotion from reaching his face. Sometimes you don't like what you catch when you set a trap; he had been a hunter enough times to know this. Later, he should probably bring it up again outside of any joke (communication was key and all that shit). Later. Now... What would he do next, if he were still playing Dream's game, unbothered? Chase after the thumb to take it into his mouth? Go for Dream's lips?

He hesitated for too long.

_And_ he had failed at keeping his hurt expression at bay.

Dream was staring at him like he was some complex mathematical problem. "**I've... upset you,**" he said uncertainly. He was doing his part in trying to decipher Hob's emotions; Hob should meet him halfway.

"Yes, you have, but you did nothing wrong," he answered, and he meant every word. "I set myself up with my own expectations, but I understand." He was picking at a hangnail on his index finger. Great. In his anxiety, he had dreamt up a hangnail. "A widower and a divorcé. We need to take things slow." Slow. They had been together for four years now, and had known each other for six hundred and thirty seven. But Hob was willing to take it as slow as Dream needed.

Hob could see the gears turning in Dream's head as he processed his words and the moment understanding dawned on his face. "**Oh, my dearest Hob,**" he whispered, and Hob wanted to brush off his pity, repeating that he understood, but then Dream cupped his face between his hands and pressed their foreheads together. "**Nothing would make me happier than to be married to you. My problem is with the wedding.**"

"The wedding?"

"**As an Endless and as Lord of the Dreaming, there are things expected of me, mostly in terms of the guest list. I'd have to invite my siblings, for starters. _All_ of them.**"

"Oh," was all Hob could say, feeling rather stupid. He knew about this sort of thing. He had _lived_ it. His and Eleanor's wedding had been more of a minefield of courtly manners and ill-intentioned guests than the rustic-barn-beach-fairy-lights-mason-jar stuff that sometimes popped up in his Pinterest feed (more so lately, which was quite suspicious).

"**I cannot even guess if The Prodigal would attend or not,**" Dream continued, separating himself from Hob, clearly getting lost in his musings. "**The rest, on the other hand, would attend without a doubt, and to give Desire a chance to sabotage me...**

"Yeah, definitely, I—"

"**The old gods that have not faded away. The Kindly Ones. My wife and her sisters. An archangel or two. The Morningstar, too, would have to be invited.**"

This made Hob furrow his brow. "Isn't the war fresh enough to give you an excuse to skip that one?"

Dream shook his head. "**I wish, but it would be a great offense if we were to invite others and not them.**"

"Right. Like Maleficent in _Sleeping Beauty_, who's offended that out of all the Fair Folk—"

"**The Fair Folk! Titania... I cannot stand her.**"

"Okay, uh." Hob rubbed his eyes. "Putting aside for a moment that Titania is real and you _know_ her, love... I understand now." He took Dream's hand and traced circles into the palm in an attempt to calm him. "You don't need to keep making the guest list; we don't need a wedding. We don't need to be married. I love you. You love me. That is more than enough for me."

Dream's smile (combined with the fact that he had stopped listing beings) told Hob that he had successfully returned him back to the present moment. "**You're right. It is more than enough. As lovely as the added boon of a formal marriage might be, the wedding...**"

"...it sounds like a diplomatic nightmare, yeah."

"**I have created a few of those, if you want to meet them,**" Dream taunted, his smile growing sharp. He kept trying to teach Hob not to take words relating to his realm so lightly, but Hob kept forgetting his lessons.

"Thanks, beautiful, but I'm good," Hob laughed. "Let me rephrase: it sounds like a diplomatic pain in the arse. No wedding. We shall live in sin."

Dream seemed about to say something witty back, but then he looked pensive all of a sudden. "**Unless...**"

"Yes?" Hob prompted.

"**If our problem is that inviting one means inviting another, and so on and so forth until we exhaust all deities and spirits in this and other planes... If the guest list remained blank...**"

Hob felt the familiar tickle of adrenaline starting to pump through his veins. "Dear heart, are you suggesting we elope?"

The look Dream gave him was pure mischief. "**Are you willing, Sir Gadling? To take your King in marriage away from the prying eyes of society?**"

They were playing this game again, but now with clearer rules. Hob smirked. "My Lord, that you feel the need to ask offends me."

Dream pulled him into a kiss with such force that Hob's nose crashed painfully into his cheekbone.

In between kisses, Hob managed to ask, "We're doing it now, right?"

"**Now,**" Dream confirmed. Once again, he pressed his forehead to Hob's, his hands running up and down Hob's arms. So much movement; he was nervous.

"Fantastic. Do we need a witness?" Before he had finished his question, Hob already had his answer and he knew Dream was thinking of the exact same candidate. He could blame it on Dreaming magic making his thoughts more accesible, but in all honesty, there weren't a lot of options.

As Dream gave him one last kiss, Hob felt a familiar breeze blow in from behind him, announcing the appearance of an open door. "**I'll meet you in Fiddler's Green,**" Dream whispered against his lips before standing up and rushing away.
