# I told myself, don't get attached
## Chapter 1
Cobb stretched his legs under the table, letting his calf press against cold beskar for just a second. "Y'know, I find it hard to believe that in this big galaxy of ours, you don't have any great warrior friends to call upon to help you and Fett, and instead you have to call upon my little town."

"I'm not one to make friends," was the dry response.

Cobb had to chuckle at that. The man was magnetic. He didn't realize it—he refused to realize it—but he was magnetic. He probably thought that with his armour and his Creed and his choice of career he was nothing but a distant, unreachable presence. But folks didn't need to see his face to see he was a kind man, to see in him an ally or even a friend. To understand his deadpan sense of humor. To imagine the twist of an irresistible smile.

"But I do consider you my friend, Marshal," Mando added more softly (perhaps he had mistaken his laugh for agreement of his perceived lonely existence). "And you are a great warrior, just like the rest of your townsfolk."

Tapping his finger against the table to dissipate the sudden rush of emotions, Cobb looked down at his empty glass. "I'm happy to hear we are more than just some backwater pit stop to you, with your high-stake turf wars and galaxy-wide Jedi searches," he said, trying to strike the perfect balance in his tone between being earnest and not showing his hand. At least not fully. At least not yet.

Mando's voice sounded amused through his vocoder when he said, "Town's getting too small for you, Marshal? One dragon taken down and you are ready to take over the galaxy?"

Oh, so that's how he wanted to play. "Freetown's perfect just the way it is." Cobb leaned back in his chair, his momentary bashfulness forgotten. "The only problem is that you"—thumb up, index finger pointing at the offending Mandalorian—"keep leaving." Sometimes you can't show your hand just yet, but you can up the bet enough for the other guy to start imagining what you're keeping so close to your chest.

The aforementioned other guy was silent, but the outward twitch of his leg and the slight turn of his helmeted head towards the door said what his words didn't. *And I need to leave again right now*.

"I'm kiddin'." They both knew he wasn't. "You're a busy man, Mando, I won't keep you any longer. It's not goodbye. We'll see each other soon enough, just as long as you keep yourself out of the wrong side of a blaster." Cobb nodded towards the door, standing up to see his guest off like a proper host. And to milk any extra seconds with the Mandalorian he could get.

---

Din was not used to the almost imperceptible purr of a sleek starfighter, specially because it forced him to sit there, unable to drown out his thoughts with the sounds of a ship that needed repairs, or walk around busying himself with this or that or *anything* that wasn't the thoughts racing through his head.

What had Cobb wanted him to say? What was he supposed to do? Did Cobb want to leave Freetown with him? Was he waiting for Din's invitation? But he didn't have space, he'd need a ship with space-

No, *Freetown's perfect just the way it is*. Cobb didn't want to leave his home. Leave his beloved home, and for *Din*? Maybe he really did want Din to stay. But he had to know that that wasn't something Din did. Stay. Settle down. It's something he didn't do, but it could be something he eventually did, in a place like Freetown, with a person like Cobb...

He had been kidding, that had to be it. He had said so, and although sometimes people sometimes use that to dismiss the truth, people also sometimes tease and prod without any hidden agenda. *Dank ferrik*, how was Din supposed to pinpoint either for any given situation?

He had to stop reeling, that's what he had to do. Things were the way they were, and they would continue to be that way. Cobb would help with Fett's war, he'd see him again then, and then he'd see him every time he stopped by Freetown with whatever excuse he could come up with. This time, he had managed to ask if he could buy him a drink. It would only take him a couple hundred decades to take another step in that direction. 

## Chapter 2
"I paid Marshal Vanth a visit. You should've never left him without his armor."

Din saw white in the edges of his vision. He raised his blaster with a shaking hand. All he wanted to do was to pull the trigger. No, that wouldn't be enough. He wanted to *pounce* on this cocky stranger, wipe the sharp-toothed smirk off his blue face with blow after blow from his fists.

But Fett needed him steady. And the stranger had backup that could make the whole thing turn ugly real quick. He needed to focus on the current mission. Fucking it up would solve nothing.

It would not bring him back. He was gone, and he would stay gone. *And all because I took his armor away*.

## Chapter 3
"All repairs are now complete. All traces of the Pyke Syndicate have been eliminated. We can now officially put the whole thing behind us."

Din's attention was on Boba Fett's words, but his eyes were on Grogu at all times. As the mischievous womp rat toddled around the throne room, Din feared that he'd break something expensive or eat something important.

"And I have a little surprise for you, Djarin." Just as Boba said this, Grogu crashed into the clone's leg, raising his tiny hands to demand being picked up. Laughing, Boba grabbed him by the waist and scooted over to the right so that the child could sit next to him on the throne. 

This allowed Din to finally look at the other Mandalorian. "A surprise?" He wondered what kind of weapon it would be. It had to be a weapon. On the rare occasions when someone gifted him something, it was always a weapon. They didn't know what else to give him, and there wasn't anything else he wanted.

The answer came from Fennec, balanced on the right arm of Boba's throne, as always. "He's stable now." Din's brows furrowed with confusion. *So... not a weapon.* Fennec kept on talking, obviously unaware of this, "Fett didn't want to tell you anything until we were sure he'd pull through."

Before Din could ask for some sort of explanation or context for whatever it was Fennec was talking about, a voice spoke from the throne room entrance that led deep into the palace, and Din felt his heart hop into his mouth and his chest tighten.

"What, were you worried about me or somethin'?" And indeed, there he was. Leaning against the stone archway, the same thin frame, the same red shirt, the same red neckerchief. 

Cobb sauntered towards Din, and all Din could do is stare in shock. He wanted to reach out, touch him, grab him by the shoulders, make sure he wasn't a specter. Grogu's new teacher sometimes spoke of specters—he spoke of receiving guidance from his master years after his passing in a rescue mission gone wrong in Lothal. Din didn't consider himself close enough to the Force for any sort of thing, but how else could he explain this?

Cobb was finally close enough that Din's hand fell on a warm and tangible shoulder. The Marshal watched him with amusement. "You were..." Din began, but the sour word refused to leave his mouth.

"Nothin' some spare parts couldn't fix." Cobb raised his hand, and Din noticed that his entire right arm was now mechanical.

"Oh," was all Din said, because his mind couldn't settle on any of the many things he wanted to say to the Marshal, and it was a good thing, because they ranged from *I'm sorry, I shouldn't have left you alone and unprotected. I'll get you a new armor*, to the unhinged extremes of *I'll melt down my own armor to make sure you are never vulnerable again*, and the particularly intense: *Marry me. Marry me. I cannot bear to lose you ever again. Marry me.* 

Just about the normal amount of buckwild bullshit that his brain always put him through and that made Peli call him "way too ride-or-die at the drop of a hat".

He was staring at the metal arm, and Cobb must've taken that as mechanical curiosity because he rolled up his sleeve to allow closer inspection. And he could do that. He could pretend to care about every single wire and bolt just so he could take a step closer. He could tilt his head forwards slightly to get a better angle for his inspection, of course. Nothing else.

Somehow, even with the impenetrable beskar between them, Din sensed the moment their foreheads touched. Lightly. Barely. He felt his pulse quicken and a hot tickling sensation climb up the back of his neck. He knew he was being a coward. He was shielding himself behind Vanth's ignorance of Mandalorian culture. It wasn't fair on the Marshal, who he was leading to believe that the closeness meant nothing to Din and the press of foreheads—the *kiss*—went unnoticed because of the helmet.

Ashamed, Din took a step back, but Cobb was none the wiser to his inner turmoil. "Yeah, it's top of the line." He flexed his robotic fingers, demonstrating the responsiveness of the device, and shot Din a wink with a twinkle in his eyes. "Good thing you have such powerful friends, Mando."

Din cleared his throat and muttered, "Yeah," not bearing to look at Cobb anymore. His eyes searched the throne room for any distraction, and they fell on Fett, who looked like he was having a blast and raised his eyebrow when Din's head turned his way. Right. The other Mandalorian in the room. "In *public*?" he mouthed with a twitch of a smirk. The hot flush made its way from the back of his neck to Din's face.

Not satisfied with his torture, Boba spoke up, loud and clear, "Well, time to get a room, Djarin." He let his words hang in the air as he stood up from his throne and stretched. Din wanted the rancor to break through the grating and pull him down into the sweet release of death. He did not dare to look at Cobb to see his reaction. "The kid is getting fussy, you need to get him to bed, and dinner will be ready soon," Boba finished innocently like his pause hadn't been planned and one of the cruelest acts in the former bounty hunter's life.

"I could eat!" Cobb sounded chirp as ever, but still Din refused to look at him. He made his way to the throne and picked up Grogu, who, indeed, was starting to yawn. He just wanted to shrink to the size of a mouse droid and scuttle away into the refuge of his private quarters, but what would Cobb think? The Marshal had come back to life, and two seconds later Din was running away from him. 

Gathering his courage, he turned around to face Cobb once again. His face felt so hot he was sure his helmet was going to melt at any moment. "I'm glad you're okay, Marshal," he said, pushing all of his relief and happiness through his vocoder so his voice wouldn't sound monotone like it often did.

Cobb smiled and replied, "I'm glad I'm okay, too. And it's mighty great to see you again. Always a sight for sore eyes, you are."

Din knew himself to be a man of few words. But in his current situation, in his current state, he was a man of zero words. His words were in the red numbers. Thankfully, Grogu kicked and squirmed in his arms, upset that he had been removed from the comforts of the throne and that he couldn't make himself fully comfortable in his father's arms. "Uh, I gotta-"

"'Course. Catch you later, partner." Cobb winked again and walked out of the throne room.

## Chapter 4

As they made their way towards the dining room, Fennec placed a hand on Boba's shoulder and leaned in to whisper, "You were right to plan this surprise. That was very fun to watch."

"Oh no, I can't take the credit for that," Boba whispered back. "I knew Djarin cares about the Marshal with how highly he spoke of him as a warrior, but I didn't know he," his hand flailed as he attempted to find a way to express himself, "*cares* about him."

Fennec snickered, a sound reserved only for her various sidebars with her boss turned friend, "Oh, but he does. He really, really does," and Boba snickered too.

---

Boba kept his meals frugal as a matter of principle, so it wasn't long before plates were pushed aside and the spotchka was brought out. While the glasses were being poured and the end of a joke was being told, 8D8 shuffled out of the kitchen with a tray loaded with meat, water, and a loaf of bread.

"I'll be taking Master Djarin's food to his room now," the droid excused himself. 

Cobb drained his drink and wiped his mouth before standing up and grabbing the tray from the droid's hands. "Let me help you with that," he said. "You stay here and make sure these guys don't run out of booze."

"Have fun," Fennec muttered into her drink with a smirk, and Boba's spotchka went down the wrong pipe.

## Chapter 5
Din hovered above the crib for longer than was probably considered healthy, watching every twitch of an eyelid or curl of a claw around dreamland frogs. He would've stayed there longer, too, if it weren't for the knock on the door.

Din loathed being waited on hand and foot, but he knew Boba did it out of kindness and deference to his Creed, so he did not argue. And so, every time he stayed in Fett's palace, 8D8 would bring him his food, announcing in his robotic voice that he had brought forth dinner for "Master Djarin".

"Room service!" a playful drawl called, and Din's hand froze over the door's controls. He swallowed thickly, and opened the door.

Cobb, leaning as always, balancing a tray on one hand. "Master Djarin," he mocked as he offered Din his dinner.

"Please don't."

"You still call me "Marshal", and I had to learn your name from the random daimyo who dragged me into his bacta tank and his right-hand assassin."

Din sighed and accepted the offered tray. "Thank you..." He swallowed again. "... Cobb." Turning away from a chuckled, "Now was that so hard?", Din placed the tray in the small table his room was equipped with. As an afterthought, he realized Cobb very probably had the intention of leaving almost immediately; Din had to do his part in this exchange to communicate his desire for him to stay.

*Did* he want him to stay?

He wanted him to stay.

Just as Cobb was about to awkwardly slink away, Din turned around again and ushered him in with a stiff gesture. "Oh-kay," Cobb muttered and frowned slightly as he stepped inside, but he relaxed when he realized Din was making no moves towards sitting down to his dinner. He just stood there. Silent as always.

"I'm... I'm sorry," the Mandalorian began in a whisper. "I left you without armor, I left you vulnerable. And then, on top of that, I dragged my problems into your town. It's all my fault."

Cobb rolled his eyes. "Listen, I'm not going to stand here and let you talk about me like I'm some sweet lil' thing who can lift a blaster to save their life. I told you, I was being more careful, but sometimes, the wrong guy comes around and careful isn't enough." Not receiving even a twitch as a response, he softened his tone. "And I'm okay now, ain't I? And ain't that what matters?"

Din had never meant to imply Cobb wasn't capable of fending off for himself. He had just tried, and failed, to pour out the guilt gnawing at each and every one of his organs. He could try to put that into words, explain how deep his concern for Cobb ran. Or he could change the subject. "So you're working for Fett now?"

There was a slight pursing of lips, a shadow of resistance against abandoning the previous topic, but the Marshal gave in, for now. "Nah, I'm just waiting for the all clear from the med droid, and then it's back to Freetown for me." He gave his buckle a quick tap. "Duty calls and all that."

The words started to pour out of Din's mouth against his will. He was aware he was saying them, of course he was aware, and a rational part of him thought that all it would take is muscles pulling on bone and teeth grinding on teeth to get them to stop, but a deeper part of him knew it wouldn't be enough. 

"You're going to need a new deputy, and I don't think I'm going to be getting a lot of bounty hunting done with that new starfighter." He had turned away from Cobb without realizing and was gazing without focusing at a far wall. "Grogu could grow up, at his own pace, terrorizing the local womp rat population. Maybe if he had a home again, an actual house kind of home... And if I manage to convince his new teacher to bring the lessons to him..." He trailed off, and was suddenly way too present in this room, in front of Cobb, and with the silence following his ramblings hanging between them.

Until Cobb broke it with a sigh. "None of that's going to happen, is it?"

Din refused to answer. He wanted to explain, but he didn't know how to explain. His heart ached for *something*, for a life on the move, for a place to stay and call his own, for a home for Grogu, for safety for a little creature with so many people wanting to track him down and do him ill. If he couldn't understand what he wanted, how could he put it into words?

Luckily, in this scenario, the explanation may be lost, but in terms of *yes* or *no*, it was rather clear what silence meant.

Cobb smiled sadly. "You can't toy with a guy's heart like that, Mando."

It was the same old story. Cobb's words were so textbook flirtatious that even Din could recognize them, but there was still layer upon layer of impenetrable cues and jests and diversions and the hidden meaning of the hidden meaning. (And the aching of Din's heart.) He did not speak or understand the language of subtleties. He spoke the language of bluntness. And the occasional sarcasm that everyone else thought was still the same bluntness, which was fine by him.

He glanced at his dinner, which was getting cold. His gaze returned to Cobb. He looked at the door behind the Marshal, closed, it did so automatically. He sighed.

And he lifted his hand and unlocked his helmet.

## Chapter 6
Or at least he would've unlocked his helmet if his hand had reached the latch, but with reflexes trained by a lifetime of quick-draws, Cobb grabbed him by the wrist when he was halfway there. He said nothing. He just held him, looked at him, and raised one inquisitive eyebrow.

And Din didn't offer any resistance, neither in pulling away nor in withholding answers. "My covert..." he began, "I took off my helmet. To save the child. They said I'm no longer a Mandalorian. It doesn't matter anymore."

"And the rill convinced the jerba it was a bocatt, but it kept giving milk," was the bizarre reply from the Marshal. 

As incomprehensible as that string of words was, Din understood he was being given a choice: his hand could keep going towards his nape, or he could lower it and the whole thing would be forgotten.

There was a third option.

Because of this unexpected movement of Din's hand, this unpredicted arch forwards, Cobb's grip loosened in surprise until his hand had slipped away completely by the time Din's palm was on his cheek. He was frozen. He had no smirk to offer, no chuckle or wink.

The Marshal's skin felt warm even through the coarse leather of Din's gloves. And if he let his imagination take charge, he could almost feel the rough stubble and the softness of flesh underneath. Starting to panic at Cobb's uncharacteristic rigidness, Din moved his thumb minutely, enough to brush over a cheekbone, and the Marshal came back to life.

Cobb tilted his head into Din's hands, looking at the Mandalorian through lowered lashes. Again, he knew that there was rationally no way to comprehend what was going on underneath that impenetrable helmet, but he felt Din return his gaze, he felt the tremendous amount of anxiety the small gesture had caused him. He turned his head further into the palm cupping his face. He pressed a kiss into the glove's leather and murmured the end of a thought that always came to him when he considered what was underneath the helmet, "And there's more than one way to kiss."

Din knew that Cobb probably thought he was about to run away when he pulled his hand away, so he tried to move as quickly as possible. Without breaking the eye contact that Cobb could not possibly know existed, Din pulled his glove off with his left hand and placed it behind him where he guessed the table was. If it actually landed on the table or not was a problem for later. For now, his only concern were the rush of sensations shooting through as he returned his now bare hand to the Marshal's face.

His hand hovered close enough to feel the tickle of Cobb's stubble and the warmth emanating from his cheek, but he did not dare to bring it closer. It would be too much. Too naked, too intense. 

Cobb's soft smile conveyed more patience than Din thought he deserved as he raised his left hand to cover Din's right, and there it was, flesh on flesh, an acutely foreign experience to Din. He felt like he had thrust his hand into a nest of live wires, but he refused to let his anxiety take over. 

Once he felt Din relax, Cobb continued. He placed his right hand on Din's wrist to steady the Mandalorian's hand as gently as he could, hoping that the cold bite of the metal would not be uncomfortable. More slowly this time to give Din the chance to stop him, he began placing fleeting kisses on the other's palm.

The heat in his chest and on his face was so intense Din felt that the air he inhaled was incapable of reaching his lungs. The Marshal's lips were cool and his mechanical hand felt ice cold on Din's burning skin, but it was not enough to stop the sensation that his entire hand, his entire body, was about to burst into flames. It was too much. It was beyond too much. Din was going to combust, his heart was going to split at the seams, or worse yet, he was going to start spilling his feelings and end up proposing over a handful of chaste kisses.

"Cobb..." He also needed a drink of water, judging by his raspy throat. 

Cobb lowered their joint hands to his chest. "Everything alright there, partner?"

*Nothing is alright in several different ways.* "I..." *I never want to ever leave your side again.* *I want you to come with me.* *I want to stay.* *I can't stay.* *If I ever lose you again...*. There wasn't much space left between him and the Marshal, but he still took a step forwards to make it minimal and pressed his forehead to Cobb's. He had yet to explain the significance, but it didn't feel dishonest anymore. "I can't ask you to leave your home," he finally said.

Cobb ran his thumb over the hand he continued to hold against his chest (and didn't have the intention of releasing any time soon). "Have you *tried* asking me?"

## Chapter 7

Din stepped back at this, his hand (at Cobb's great dismay) slipping from the Marshal's grip. What was Cobb trying to say to him? Was he joking again? It wasn't a confirmation of his answer in case Din were to ask him, so if Din *did* ask him, the possibility of him saying no still existed, and Din would once again be the fool that didn't understand subtleties. "But Freetown..." was all he managed.

Cobb sighed. "Listen, I'm gonna be honest. If you had asked me a little while ago, I would've said no. Broken my heart, it would've, but I would've chosen to stay with my town. But now..." He glanced down at his right arm, curling and uncurling his pinkie to convince himself it was his, before sighing again. "I think I should start to consider retirement."

This was clearly a very delicate subject for the Marshal, and Din understood why. Folks like them never consider retirement; they keep going until the wrong guy sends them into one eternal retirement you never come back from. But Din had considered retirement, once with Omera, another time with Cobb. And now Cobb was considering it, too. Because of Din. *With* Din. Sure, if he left with Din, it wouldn't be one peaceful retirement, but the sentiment remained: stepping back from his duties to be with him. Din had no idea how to respond to this, and his eyes were starting to sting with gathering tears.

Where people often only saw an unresponsive mask of beskar, Cobb always acted like he saw every inch of his emotions. He chuckled and patted his chestplate. "Now, now, before you take what's left of my sanity with your sweet, sweet smile: it's not a *right away* kind of thing." The hand on Din's chest started tracing random patterns on the smooth metal as Cobb's mind wandered off to future plans. "There's some things I have to settle, I certainly do need a new deputy to leave in my stead, someone's got to continue relations with the tuskens..." He lifted his gaze to Din's visor. "But it's a *soon* kind of thing, I promise." He was one perceptive son of a mother, and the gesture that Din had done twice now had not gone unnoticed. With a soft touch to the back of Din's helmet, he pressed their foreheads together. "I'll be waiting for you right here, you know that."

The surprise at Cobb's Keldabe kiss was washed away by the sour taste that rushed to Din's mouth. "Cad Bane took that certainty away from me," he growled.

Cobb gave the back of his helmet a reprimanding tap. "Hush. None of that right now." He was right. Din didn't want to speak of that anymore. He just wanted to put his arms around the Marshal's waist and hold him, alive, tangible, safe, *his*, now and forever. His thoughts were getting a bit too intense again.

"You need to eat your dinner."

"Don't want to."

Cobb blew air out of his nose. "You and your son are very different." 

"I don't know where he gets it," Din replied, feeling his smile grow even wider.

Cobb gave out a chuckle (he always got the sarcasm no one else seemed to get), and as he lifted his head, his hands slipped from the back of Din's head to his neck, sliding over the fabric until they landed on his shoulders. "I'll leave you to it," he said, but didn't move away. "Can I...?"

In some remote part of his brain, Din considered that the wise thing to do was let the Marshal finish his request, or at least say a few words beyond "can I" to gauge its nature. He didn't care. "Yes. Anything," he blurted out.

Looking quite amused at his interjection, Cobb reached around to undo his kerchief and placed it around Din's neck, the red fabric stark against the silver beskar. As he tied it securely, he said, "So you don't forget you've got someone here waiting for you when you go off in your next big adventure."

A heavy knot formed in the back of Din's throat, and a few of the tears finally fulfilled their threat and ran down his cheeks. It was almost like Cobb *knew*. It wasn't just the significance of the item as Cobb's staple accessory, it was... well, it was red. Obviously, Din couldn't be sure, but he decided it was the same red he had stopped wearing many years ago. Maybe it was time to start wearing it again. "Wouldn't dream of it," he whispered in reply.

Finally managing to separate himself from Din, Cobb stepped back to admire the way the accessory looked on its new owner. "Yup, you are not getting rid of me any time soon, Mando."

"Whatever will I do." Din knew that Cobb knew, *somehow*, that he had the stupidest grin on his face as he watched him leave.
