# You can't plant me in your penthouse (I'm going back to my plough)
## Chapter 1
She found him staring at a wall. Someone else, someone not in tune with the Force, would've reverently called it "meditating" and would've walked away quietly. But she could feel the churning emotions; he was upset, frustrated, and not even trying to meditate. Just staring at the stone wall of the small circular hut. No sense pretending she might distract him. "There you are, Skykid!" she exclaimed and ruffled his hair before sitting down on the ground in front of him.

"Ahsoka," Luke all but whined, "you interrupted me, I was..." She raised her eyebrow, and Luke trailed off, lowering his eyes.

"You can meditate peacefully, you can meditate angrily, but you have to have the intent of meditating." It was an odd relationship: not quite master and padwan, not quite equals. She had met him as a grown man—the saviour of the Galaxy, not just any grown man—and yet she sometimes saw him as a little boy her Master had left in her care.

"Hm. Yeah." The answer was noncommittal. He did not like being seen as a little boy.

Ahsoka sighed. "Alright. What's bothering you?"

"What do you think?"

"Again?"

"Always."

"He made his own choice."

"He's a _baby_, Ahsoka, of course he chose his father." Luke uncrossed his legs and bent them to the left, tucking them under his body. Less Jedi, more Luke. "I was afraid of uncertainty and stuck to a tradition I said I was going to change. I was wrong in making him choose." He finally looked away from the dusty ground to give Ahsoka a sideways glance. "And I know you agree that I was wrong."

Ahsoka shifted uncomfortably. She had been enjoying pretending neutrality. "Skykid..." she began, gently handpicking her words, "Luke. I kept the Mandalorian away so you wouldn't get thrown off your rhythm. As for the rest... I was not expecting it. And I wasn't expecting you to follow through."

"I made a commitment, Ahsoka. A stupid one, but a commitment nonetheless. I couldn't go back on my word."

"Proud," Ahsoka smirked, and Luke's mouth twisted into a tiny petulant frown. 

They stayed like that for a while, listening to the sounds of wildlife beyond the hut and the comfortable silence inside the hut. Luke traced patterns in the dirt, and Ahsoka watched him as she felt his foul mood untangle and begin to relax. When he spoke again, his voice was much lighter.

"It was a cute shirt, though."

"It was a _really_ cute shirt," Ahsoka agreed with a laugh.

Luke nimbly jumped to his feet. "I'm going to have to leave you for a little bit," and then added with sharp irony, "It's not like any of my many students are going to miss me." The silence of the empty school answered him.

Choosing to ignore the latter, Ahsoka stood up, too, and asked, "Where are you going to go?"

Luke's blue eyes were steeled with resolution. "Luke Skywalker does not abandon a student."
