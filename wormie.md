# You can't plant me in your penthouse (I'm going back to my plough)
## Chapter 1
She found him staring at a wall. Someone else, someone not in tune with the Force, would've reverently called it "meditating" and would've walked away quietly. But she could feel the churning emotions; he was upset, frustrated, and not even trying to meditate. Just staring at the stone wall of the small circular hut. No sense pretending she might distract him. "There you are, Skykid!" she exclaimed and ruffled his hair before sitting down on the ground in front of him.

"Ahsoka," Luke all but whined, "you interrupted me, I was..." She raised her eyebrow, and Luke trailed off, lowering his eyes.

"You can meditate peacefully, you can meditate angrily, but you have to have the intent of meditating." It was an odd relationship: not quite master and padwan, not quite equals. She had met him as a grown man—the saviour of the Galaxy, not just any grown man—and yet she sometimes saw him as a little boy her Master had left in her care.

"Hm. Yeah." The answer was noncommittal. He did not like being seen as a little boy.

Ahsoka sighed. "Alright. What's bothering you?"

"What do you think?"

"Again?"

"Always."

"He made his own choice."

"He's a _baby_, Ahsoka, of course he chose his father." Luke uncrossed his legs and bent them to the left, tucking them under his body. Less Jedi, more Luke. "I was afraid of uncertainty and stuck to a tradition I said I was going to change. I was wrong in making him choose." He finally looked away from the dusty ground to give Ahsoka a sideways glance. "And I know you agree that I was wrong."

Ahsoka shifted uncomfortably. She had been enjoying pretending neutrality. "Skykid..." she began, gently handpicking her words, "Luke. I kept the Mandalorian away so you wouldn't get thrown off your rhythm. As for the rest... I was not expecting it. And I wasn't expecting you to follow through."

"I made a commitment, Ahsoka. A stupid one, but a commitment nonetheless. I couldn't go back on my word."

"Proud," Ahsoka smirked, and Luke's mouth twisted into a tiny petulant frown. 

They stayed like that for a while, listening to the sounds of wildlife beyond the hut and the comfortable silence inside the hut. Luke traced patterns in the dirt, and Ahsoka watched him as she felt his foul mood untangle and begin to relax. When he spoke again, his voice was much lighter.

"It was a cute shirt, though."

"It was a _really_ cute shirt," Ahsoka agreed with a laugh.

Luke nimbly jumped to his feet. "I'm going to have to leave you for a little bit," and then added with sharp irony, "It's not like any of my many students are going to miss me." The silence of the empty school answered him.

Choosing to ignore the latter, Ahsoka stood up, too, and asked, "Where are you going to go?"

Luke's blue eyes were steeled with resolution. "Luke Skywalker does not abandon a student."

## Chapter 2
His only lead pointed to Tatooine. Of course it was Tatooine. It was always Tatooine.

"You told me someone recognized him at the hangar where you arrived, right?" R2 chirped an affirmative. "Great. Take me to the same one, I'll start asking there." 

Luke had changed out of his black robes. As much as he loved his new style, he knew how unforgiving his home's suns could be. The new brown ones were more fitted and more stylish than anything he had worn back in his Tatooine days, and the black glove on his right hand was a stark reminder of the time that had passed. But he still felt younger, a foolish little boy shuffling back home to fix his mistakes.

Waving one last goodbye to Ahsoka, his pulled his X-Wing into the sky.

Luke could see the woman's lips moving before he landed, and he caught her mid explanation when he opened the cockpit. "— I keep telling them I need my papers in order, officer, they just won't listen. You gotta understand. Let me fix you to a spot of spotchka for the trip back, and maybe a little something else—" R2's beeps informed him that this was not the first time this woman was _just_ about to get her papers in order. "Hey, I know you!" the woman exclaimed, "You are the little bad-mouthed droid that dropped the kid off." Her eyes narrowed when she turned to Luke. "If he's your droid, you've got some explaining to do. About sending the kid out on his own. Not the bad mouth. I've heard worse."

Great. His ship had barely touched the ground and he was already being told off like the boy who didn't close the eopie pen. "Yes, he... I'm looking for him. Can you help me?"

The woman laughed with her whole body. "Oh, I see. You didn't send him off on his own, the little womp rat escaped! And stole an X-Wing! Boy, it sure did take you a while to track him down." She pointed at R2 accusingly. "The droid was in on it, you know."

Now, wouldn't that be easy. Just to nod along and laugh. The kid had escaped! Luke had been worried sick! No one had clung to ill-interpreted rules about attachments like a safety blanket! What a simple and dishonorable solution that would be. "No," he replied solemnly. "I did send him off. I was wrong. I want to see him again. I want to, no, I _have_ to apologize."

He was expecting the woman to tell him off again and then kick him out of her hangar, but the small smile on her lips showed understanding. "Park that thing out of the way. If you can cover it, better. Don't want any customers being spooked by the idea of nearby cops." As Luke cruised to a roofed section of the hangar, the woman walked next to the ship and kept talking. "You are in luck, kid. He's been out and about with his dad, but every now and then they'll stop here for a breather, and they're scheduled to arrive today. They stay for a while, so you'll have plenty of time for your apology."

Force. That was fast. So very, very fast. And his father was going to be with him (of course his father was going to be with him), he was going to get his ass kicked by a Mandalorian. He was going to _let_ a Mandalorian kick his ass; he believed he had it in him to hold his own, but he didn't think he should. Not after how stupid he had been. The X-Wing was parked and covered. He wanted to crawl under the tarp, too.

"Will you stop fidgeting over there? Help me with these boxes! I'm not running a leisure resort here, do something if you're going to be hanging around."

He lifted the boxes directly with his hands and even pretended to struggle a bit. Either the woman was being discreet (seemed unlikely) or she truly had not recognized him. Either way, he didn't want to draw any attention. 

## Chapter 3
By the time the ship arrived, the boxes had long been moved, emptied, and moved again. Luke was sitting on top of them, his feet dangling without touching the ground. It was the first ship that had arrived after his own, but he had no way of knowing if it was the one he was waiting for.

The first person to walk out of it made him think that it was not, because he was a stranger. He swaggered towards Luke, thumb hooked on a lopsided belt. "You hired a helper, Peli?" the stranger asked towards him, but not at him. He eyed Luke up and down intensely, and Luke quickly did the same even though it was not necessary to asses the situation. The stranger was handsome, handsome enough to make Luke's stomach flip. He also seemed to be about twice his age, and that was a can of worms Luke constantly chose _not_ to open. There was a symbol on his belt buckle that Luke swore he had seen before, but couldn't place where. 

Even with the initial question, it wasn't certain that the stranger hadn't recognized him. Judging by the intensity of his gaze, if he had, Luke would have to brace himself for a fight. His fingers twitched over his lightsaber through the robe. 

"What's your name, kid?"

Luke reached out through the Force and found only honesty. Not recognized once again. Blessed anonymity, he might just end up liking being here after all. "Luke," he answered simply. A bit of a risk, but it made the anonymity taste even sweeter when the stranger did not react.

"Well, Luke, are you Peli's new helper or not?"

The woman (Peli, apparently, she hadn't shared her name with Luke before) replied for him. "Please. Like I'd hire some fancy-looking offworlder." Strangely, the remark stung. "He's just here waiting for— Ah, speak of the devil!"

The Mandalorian shone in the Tatooine suns. There was an energy to him, like all the noise in the galaxy suddenly stopped and tuned themselves to his beat, to draw everything in, to make him the center of it all. And there was that symbol, right over his shoulder. And in his arms... oh, there he was. Luke's heart fluttered when he felt the Force signature of the sleeping child mix with his own. "Jedi," was all the Mandalorian said, and Luke saw the stranger's eyebrows rise.

"Hello again," Luke greeted, controlling his tone. He might feel like a foolish little boy, but had enough pride to at least appear calm and professional. 

No one else said anything until the stranger cleared his throat. "Uh, alright. I, uh, thought we had already gone through the introductions, but I'm gonna need a bit more information here, please."

"Right." With the hand not cradling Grogu, the Mandalorian gestured towards Luke. "This is Luke Skywalker, Grogu's first Jedi teacher." First. That meant there was a second. Or more. "This," he placed a hand on the stranger's shoulder, "is Cobb Vanth, former Marshal of Freetown, formerly Mos Pelgo."

Vanth gave Luke his hand to shake. "Also his husband, by the way, dunno why he left _that_ out." Oh, fantastic. The man he had been drooling over was his former student's stepfather. Excellent. 

There was a deep fondness in his voice and the energy coming from him when the Mandalorian said, "I'm still not used to saying it, specially not in Basic, _cyar'ika_."

The Mandalorian's fondness was matched by the warmth in Vanth's eyes when he turned to look at him. "I'm still not used to being it, sweetheart."

Luke all of a sudden felt very alone in the great expanse of the Galaxy. He decided to change the subject to even more painful waters. "I've come to apologize, Mandalorian."
