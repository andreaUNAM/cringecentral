# You can't plant me in your penthouse (I'm going back to my plough)
## Chapter 1
She found him staring at a wall. Someone else, someone not in tune with the Force, would've reverently called it "meditating" and would've walked away quietly. But she could feel the churning emotions; he was upset, frustrated, and not even trying to meditate. Just staring at the stone wall of the small circular hut. No sense pretending she might distract him. "There you are, Skykid!" she exclaimed and ruffled his hair before sitting down on the ground in front of him.

"Ahsoka," Luke all but whined, "you interrupted me, I was..." She raised her eyebrow, and Luke trailed off, lowering his eyes.

"You can meditate peacefully, you can meditate angrily, but you have to have the intent of meditating." It was an odd relationship: not quite master and padwan, not quite equals. She had met him as a grown man—the saviour of the Galaxy, not just any grown man—and yet she sometimes saw him as a little boy her Master had left in her care.

"Hm. Yeah." The answer was noncommittal. He did not like being seen as a little boy.

Ahsoka sighed. "Alright. What's bothering you?"

"What do you think?"

"Again?"

"Always."

"He made his own choice."

"He's a _baby_, Ahsoka, of course he chose his father." Luke uncrossed his legs and bent them to the left, tucking them under his body. Less Jedi, more Luke. "I was afraid of uncertainty and stuck to a tradition I said I was going to change. I was wrong in making him choose." He finally looked away from the dusty ground to give Ahsoka a sideways glance. "And I know you agree that I was wrong."

Ahsoka shifted uncomfortably. She had been enjoying pretending neutrality. "Skykid..." she began, gently handpicking her words, "Luke. I kept the Mandalorian away so you wouldn't get thrown off your rhythm. As for the rest... I was not expecting it. And I wasn't expecting you to follow through."

"I made a commitment, Ahsoka. A stupid one, but a commitment nonetheless. I couldn't go back on my word."

"Proud," Ahsoka smirked, and Luke's mouth twisted into a tiny petulant frown. 

They stayed like that for a while, listening to the sounds of wildlife beyond the hut and the comfortable silence inside the hut. Luke traced patterns in the dirt, and Ahsoka watched him as she felt his foul mood untangle and begin to relax. When he spoke again, his voice was much lighter.

"It was a cute shirt, though."

"It was a _really_ cute shirt," Ahsoka agreed with a laugh.

Luke nimbly jumped to his feet. "I'm going to have to leave you for a little bit," and then added with sharp irony, "It's not like any of my many students are going to miss me." The silence of the empty school answered him.

Choosing to ignore the latter, Ahsoka stood up, too, and asked, "Where are you going to go?"

Luke's blue eyes were steeled with resolution. "Luke Skywalker does not abandon a student."

## Chapter 2
His only lead pointed to Tatooine. Of course it was Tatooine. It was always Tatooine.

"You told me someone recognized him at the hangar where you arrived, right?" R2 chirped an affirmative. "Great. Take me to the same one, I'll start asking there." 

Luke had changed out of his black robes. As much as he loved his new style, he knew how unforgiving his home's suns could be. The new brown ones were more fitted and more stylish than anything he had worn back in his Tatooine days, and the black glove on his right hand was a stark reminder of the time that had passed. But he still felt younger, a foolish little boy shuffling back home to fix his mistakes.

Waving one last goodbye to Ahsoka, his pulled his X-Wing into the sky.

---

Luke could see the woman's lips moving before he landed, and he caught her mid explanation when he opened the cockpit. "— I keep telling them I need my papers in order, officer, they just won't listen. You gotta understand. Let me fix you to a spot of spotchka for the trip back, and maybe a little something else—" R2's beeps informed him that this was not the first time this woman was _just_ about to get her papers in order. "Hey, I know you!" the woman exclaimed, "You are the little bad-mouthed droid that dropped the kid off." Her eyes narrowed when she turned to Luke. "If he's your droid, you've got some explaining to do. About sending the kid out on his own. Not the bad mouth. I've heard worse."

Great. His ship had barely touched the ground and he was already being told off like the boy who didn't close the eopie pen. "Yes, he... I'm looking for him. Can you help me?"

The woman laughed with her whole body. "Oh, I see. You didn't send him off on his own, the little womp rat escaped! And stole an X-Wing! Boy, it sure did take you a while to track him down." She pointed at R2 accusingly. "The droid was in on it, you know."

Now, wouldn't that be easy. Just to nod along and laugh. The kid had escaped! Luke had been worried sick! No one had clung to ill-interpreted rules about attachments like a safety blanket! What a simple and dishonorable solution that would be. "No," he replied solemnly. "I did send him off. I was wrong. I want to see him again. I want to, no, I _have_ to apologize."

He was expecting the woman to tell him off again and then kick him out of her hangar, but the small smile on her lips showed understanding. "Park that thing out of the way. If you can cover it, better. Don't want any customers being spooked by the idea of nearby cops." As Luke cruised to a roofed section of the hangar, the woman walked next to the ship and kept talking. "You are in luck, kid. He's been out and about with his dad, but every now and then they'll stop here for a breather, and they're scheduled to arrive today. They stay for a while, so you'll have plenty of time for your apology."

Force. That was fast. So very, very fast. And his father was going to be with him (of course his father was going to be with him), he was going to get his ass kicked by a Mandalorian. He was going to _let_ a Mandalorian kick his ass; he believed he had it in him to hold his own, but he didn't think he should. Not after how stupid he had been. The X-Wing was parked and covered. He wanted to crawl under the tarp, too.

"Will you stop fidgeting over there? Help me with these boxes! I'm not running a leisure resort here, do something if you're going to be hanging around."

He lifted the boxes directly with his hands and even pretended to struggle a bit. Either the woman was being discreet (seemed unlikely) or she truly had not recognized him. Either way, he didn't want to draw any attention. 

## Chapter 3
By the time the ship arrived, the boxes had long been moved, emptied, and moved again. Luke was sitting on top of them, his feet dangling without touching the ground. It was the first ship that had arrived after his own, but he had no way of knowing if it was the one he was waiting for.

The first person to walk out of it made him think that it was not, because he was a stranger. He swaggered towards Luke, thumb hooked on a lopsided belt. "You hired a helper, Peli?" the stranger asked towards him, but not at him. He eyed Luke up and down intensely, and Luke quickly did the same even though it was not necessary to asses the situation. The stranger was handsome, handsome enough to make Luke's stomach flip. He also seemed to be about twice his age, and that was a can of worms Luke constantly chose _not_ to open. There was a symbol on his belt buckle that Luke swore he had seen before, but couldn't place where. 

Even with the initial question, it wasn't certain that the stranger hadn't recognized him. Judging by the intensity of his gaze, if he had, Luke would have to brace himself for a fight. His fingers twitched over his lightsaber through the robe. 

"What's your name, kid?"

Luke reached out through the Force and found only honesty. Not recognized once again. Blessed anonymity, he might just end up liking being here after all. "Luke," he answered simply. A bit of a risk, but it made the anonymity taste even sweeter when the stranger did not react.

"Well, Luke, are you Peli's new helper or not?"

The woman (Peli, apparently, she hadn't shared her name with Luke before) replied for him. "Please. Like I'd hire some fancy-looking offworlder." Strangely, the remark stung. "He's just here waiting for— Ah, speak of the devil!"

The Mandalorian shone in the Tatooine suns. There was an energy to him, like all the noise in the galaxy suddenly stopped and tuned themselves to his beat, to draw everything in, to make him the center of it all. And there was that symbol, right over his shoulder. And in his arms... oh, there he was. Luke's heart fluttered when he felt the Force signature of the sleeping child mix with his own. "Jedi," was all the Mandalorian said, and Luke saw the stranger's eyebrows rise.

"Hello again," Luke greeted as he stood up, controlling his tone. He might feel like a foolish little boy, but had enough pride to at least appear calm and professional. 

No one else said anything until the stranger cleared his throat. "Uh, alright. I, uh, thought we had already gone through the introductions, but I'm gonna need a bit more information here, please."

"Right." With the hand not cradling Grogu, the Mandalorian gestured towards Luke. "This is Luke Skywalker, Grogu's first Jedi teacher." First. That meant there was a second. Or more. "This," he placed a hand on the stranger's shoulder, "is Cobb Vanth, former Marshal of Freetown, formerly Mos Pelgo."

Vanth gave Luke his hand to shake. "Also his husband, by the way, dunno why he left _that_ out." Oh, fantastic. The man he had been drooling over was his former student's stepfather. Excellent. 

There was a deep fondness in his voice and the energy coming from him when the Mandalorian said, "I'm still not used to saying it, specially not in Basic, _cyar'ika_."

The Mandalorian's fondness was matched by the warmth in Vanth's eyes when he turned to look at him. "I'm still not used to being it, sweetheart."

Luke all of a sudden felt very alone in the great expanse of the Galaxy. He decided to change the subject to even more painful waters. "I've come to apologize, Mandalorian." The Mandalorian's only reply was a hum in the back of his throat, so Luke continued, "Your child shouldn't have to choose between his father and his path as a Jedi. I made a mistake." _This is Luke Skywalker, Grogu's_ first _Jedi teacher._ "I understand that the position to teach the child is no longer open—"

"It's not."

"—and I understand, but I still needed to apologize."

The Mandalorian just stared at him for what seemed like ages. Vanth had moved away with Peli to give them some space, so it was just a one on one staring contest. Did Mandalorian armor shield the user from being probed by the Force? No, that was stupid. Luke was just making excuses for the fact that he wasn't really trying to sense the Mandalorian's emotions, afraid of what he might find. 

Finally: "Okay." And the Mandalorian turned around a walked towards a waiting speeder.

As Luke stood there, dumbfounded, he felt Vanth's laugh stir the hairs on his neck as he walked up from behind him. "That means he accepts your apology, and it's getting quite late, so won't you join us for dinner?" He placed a hand on the small of Luke's back (it was a testament to his training that he didn't jump at the sudden touch) and led him towards the speeder. 

"It didn't mean all of that," the Mandalorian grumbled as he tucked Grogu in a makeshift bed on the front row of the speeder's seats.

"Now don't be so rude, darling," his husband chided. "The kid came here from who knows what side of the Galaxy to talk to you and you are going to leave him alone in an unknown planet?"

Luke cleared his throat, "Uh, actually, I grew up in Tatooine."

"Huh. Well, I'll be damned," Vanth exclaimed with raised eyebrows. "I didn't know we had some fancy Jedi palace hiding somewhere in our dirtball." He patted Luke on the shoulder and hopped onto the copilot seat. Luke decided he wasn't going to correct him, and he silently climbed onto the back seat.

## Chapter 4
When they drove out of town and into the waiting desert, Luke asked where they were going. Vanth explained that they had a "small place" (the Mandalorian chuckled here) where they liked to lay low and rest when they were on Tatooine. He would go visit his town in the morning, but Din and Grogu would stay there as long as they remained on the planet.

Din. The Mandalorian had a name.

At one point during the ride, Grogu woke up and peeked over the seat. When his eyes confirmed what he had sensed through the Force, his ears perked up. "Hey there, little one," Luke greeted, and the kid cooed in reply. 

"Sit down, Grogu, or you'll fly right off," the Mandalorian—Din—said. There was no resentment in his voice, but the modulator in his helmet could be concealing it. Luke decided he was going to look at the rolling dunes instead.

---

He had been uneasy with the situation the entire time, but his anxiety rose when horribly familiar towers appeared in the horizon. They seemed to be riding straight for them, and it's not like there were other places around they could be heading towards. Maybe there was still time to make a turn, for their course to point them elsewhere. Luke held his breath, waiting.

But Din's steering never changed. 

So. Time to asses. Working theory: The Mandalorian had no intention of forgiving him, maybe even knew he was coming. Everyone else had pretended not to recognize him. They knew of his run-in with the Hutts and were about to collect a hefty sum for bringing him to whoever had taken Jabba's place. These were, after all, a bounty hunter, a stranger... and a child. Well. It was still a working theory, after all. 

"Where," he repeated tensely, his fingers wrapping around his lightsaber, "are we going?"

Everyone on the front seat seemed confused by his change in demeanor, which was a good sign. Or a shitty move, to keep feigning ignorance. Grogu pulled himself up again and tilted his head quizzically. Din looked away from the road (or at least his helmet turned to the side, his eyes could still be facing forwards) and replied, "The same place we were going last time you asked." Vanth just stared at him blankly, but Luke could tell his hand moved towards his holster, although that could be a precaution to protect his family. 

"I believe," the former Marshal began carefully, "that our friend recognizes the ex-Hutt palace and it is not the family resort he had in mind. I can assure you: you will be safe. You have nothing to worry about."

"Ex-Hutt?"

"Yes, a woman we know only as the Hutt Slayer—"

"I'm familiar with the story of Jabba's demise."

"Well, after the old slug croaked, there's been a couple of changes in management, and the man in charge now... he's a good man." As a sign of good will, Vanth added with a friendly smirk, "Just don't say it to his face, he'll throw a fit. He has this whole persona in his mind."

Luke could feel Grogu watching him. Grogu. He could trust Grogu. And from what he had gathered from his first meeting with Din, there was no deception between the pair, so if he could trust Grogu, he could trust Din. Vanth... Even if he was playing a long con, if shit hit the fan and he turned, he would be turning against Din, too, and the resulting fight— It didn't matter, it seemed very unlikely. The way they looked at each other... not something that can be pretended. 

He let go of his lightsaber and relaxed in his seat. "Alright. Sorry."

"No worries, partner," Vanth beamed.

"We've all been there," Din agreed.

## Chapter 5
They couldn't possibly mean _him_. Surely, between their visits of Tatooine, there had been yet another "change in management" and _this man_ had taken over. And yet no one but Luke reacted as the hangar door slid open, revealing the man in green armor. He had his helmet under his arm and a warm smile on his face, but his expression soured when his eyes met Luke's. At least the feeling was mutual.

"You brought me a prisoner as a present?" was the bounty hunter's greeting, and Luke's nerves were once again on edge.

"Kriff, Fett, you are going to spook him," Din growled as he killed the speeder's engine.

"We found a stray and brought him over for dinner, can you show some manners?" Vanth seconded. "And I just gave him my word that he'd have nothing to worry about here, don't make me look bad."

Boba Fett's cold stare remained on Luke as the Jedi got off the speeder, even as he put his helmet back on. "You should've called ahead so I'd have an extra plate at my table. Only the best for Lord _Jetii_, the man who threw me into the pit."

Judging by how close Din, Vanth, and Fett seemed to be, Luke expected the former two to have a significant reaction to such an accusation, but Vanth just rolled his eyes. "Yeah, yeah, you've told us a thousand times before, and if you want you can tell us again over dinner, after I've gone to the fresher." He patted Fett's shoulder and walked into the palace like he owned the place.

Din finished unloading some bags from the speeder before lifting Grogu out and immediately placing him back down on the hangar floor to wander about freely, and if _that_ wasn't definite proof of the amount of trust he had on the other bounty hunter, Force knows what was. "Don't forget to say hi to Boba," he instructed distractedly, as if the child wasn't already on his way to some palace adventure. Din, on the other hand, did not forget to say hi to Boba. The two Mandalorian's clasped their hands and pulled each other close, pressing helmeted forehead against helmeted forehead. Luke barely managed to hear Din whisper, "Please behave," before they separated and started walking into the palace.

Luke shuffled behind them, feeling more and more out of place.

---

Everything was so eerily quiet. They didn't run into anyone as they made their way deep into the palace, no teams of bounty hunters, no Twi'lek dancers, no servants, no guards. Fett caught on to the way Luke was scanning the empty hallways and gruffly explained, "I don't need as much staff as the past idiots did. A handful of trusted friends and fighters is always better than a legion of potential traitors. And I think I've finally outgrown what used to pass as _entertainment_ in these places." 

Despite the clear disgust in Fett's voice in that last statement, Luke's jaw tightened. "_Entertainment_ like my sister?"

Fett's helmet impeded Luke from seeing the surprise on his face, but the way his steps faltered gave it away. "That was your sister?"

Luke decided he was done with the small talk, lowering his hood and putting his hands up his sleeves. If Vanth had been with them instead of getting a head start, he would've probably tried to ease the tension with a joke and smirk. His husband, on the other hand, was silent as was his custom, which Luke preferred at the moment. This way he could process his mixed feelings about Fett, the situation, and the fact that he was apparently memorizing the mannerisms of not one, but two married men.

--- 

Tensions had thankfully eased by dinnertime. Luke still felt like an intruder, but at least the situation relaxed as such an odd collection of people gathered for what can only be called a family dinner. When they had arrived at the dining room (which was much more modest than Luke had expected it to be), there was already a woman clad in leather with a long black braid sitting on the seat to the right of the head of the table. She eyed the incoming party with an unchanging serious expression, but Luke could sense that only he was unwelcome. She also gave him the feeling that she already knew who he was, the serial number of his X-Wing's engine, the address of the small apartment in Coruscant he used when he visited Leia, and the exact date his nephew was due to be born.

Vanth joined them almost immediately, having found Grogu on his way. The two finally added some chatter to the previously silent room. The former Marshal was the one who ushered Luke to sit opposite to Fett, which was both a relief considering it was the farthest seat from him, and a cause for unease because it made him feel caught right in the bounty hunter's crosshair.

Just as a their dinner was brought forward by a droid (an 8D-series, for some bizarre reason), the last two members of their party arrived. 

"Sorry, sorry, game ran longer than expected," the young woman said as she slipped into her chair, and her companion kicked his chair back before sprawling on it. Fett just eyed them with a raised eyebrow, and Luke got the strangest recollection of Uncle Owen looking at him similarly the one and only time he had missed curfew after being dragged into a dingy cantina by Biggs.

The man's cybernetics were the most obvious ones. Of course, a modification as drastic as an eye was often hard to hide, but he didn't seem to _want_ to hide it. And the woman... her left arm, bright red and uncovered. And Luke hadn't failed to notice that Vanth's right arm was also cybernetic, and he also wore it uncovered and with that stupidly attractive confidence. His gloved hand clenched around his fork, the creak of the leather concealing the whir of the mechanism. How did they do it?

With her mouth full of stew, the woman with the cybernetic arm interrupted Luke's thoughts, whatever quiet conversation Vanth and the woman with the braid were having, and the soft coos between Grogu and Din as the latter convinced the former to eat his vegetables. "So, is anyone going to explain who the new guy is?"

Surprisingly, Fett was the one to answer. "Just some punk who likes going around doing silly little backflips, slicing people's blasters, and getting them thrown into monster's maws." Even more surprising, his tone was light and playful. Somehow, it almost made sense. After all, he had allowed Luke to enter his palace and join them for a very intimate dinner. The reason was still wildly unclear, but it appeared that his resentment was not too sharp.

This was clearly not just a dinner with close friends but a dinner with insane people, for the woman's only reply was a quiet "Huh" and a nod. Luke must've had his confusion written on his face because Fett continued, "Kid, it was me or you, and you fought to make sure it wasn't you. Nothing wrong with that. There were plenty of other people there that day that I resent much more than you." He fished a piece of meat from his stew and pointed the fork at Luke. "Like Solo. Fuck Solo." As he chewed his meat, the attention of every adult in the room did not waver away from him (Grogu was poking down the solids in his stew just to watch them float up again). "You've also got a good word for you put in by Djarin and his clan, and that is something I do not take lightly."

Din nodded solemnly. Grogu blew a raspberry at a piece of potato. Vanth caught Luke's eye and winked. 

Luke had to take a beat to control his fluster. "I am thankful, lord Fett, although I cannot say I have earned their good word. I made a mistake, and I abandoned my student dishonorably."

Despite the helmet between them, Din's gaze was piercing. "You're here now, aren't you?"

## Chapter 6
Vanth left the next morning, but Luke didn't. In fact, he didn't leave for several mornings. At one point he even moved his X-Wing into the palace hangar when he had only planned to go back to Peli's to fetch his spare robes. R2 had some colorful things to say about being left under the tarp, so the whole thing was moved.

No one had asked him to stay, but no one told him to leave, either. And it felt so natural to simply stay, almost a silent phantom moving around the palace while everyone else led their lives as usual. It didn't feel like special treatment from Din and the woman who he learnt was Fennec Shand, with their reserved personalities. The Mods, Luke learnt, were not as permanent a fixture at the palace as he had initially thought. Despite the peace offering during that first dinner, Fett gave him something of a cold shoulder, which Luke understood and seconded, always giving the throne room a wide berth. 

And he was actively avoiding Vanth. Din he could deal with; when they spent long stretches of time in silence, each focused on their own task, it was easy for Luke not to look too closely at how the strength and love for his son radiating from Din made him feel a deep, warm peace. But Vanth... in the first few times when he came back from visiting Freetown and Luke had been so cloddish as to allow himself to spend some time with the former Marshal... how he goaded conversation out of Luke, how he laughed, how his eyes twinkled, how he held himself, how he was fiercely loyal, how he insisted Luke call him Cobb... it made Luke weak in the knees. He knew it was merely a crush and that he had an impecable training in restraint. But he had come here to make amends with his former padwan, and getting doe-eyed around said padwan's stepfather was not the way to go.

So he did the mature, responsible thing and scuttled away whenever Vanth was nearby. 

---

He hadn't been heading anywhere in particular. The size and safety of the palace had helped him discover the wonders of walking meditations, of letting his steps keep time for his breathing as his mind retreated into the Force. Sometimes he'd even sense Obi-Wan's spirit join him and they'd both simply walk and walk. There were turns, there were stairs, both to climb and to descend, but he had no intention of remembering or planning his trajectory. Walking past the workshop should've been just like walking past all those other doors.

"Hey there, stranger."

Luke wondered if he could just keep walking and make something up later about Jedi trances. His heart did not agree. That was another problem: his heart very much enjoyed being treated so normally and basking under the pretense of being wooed, even if this was just a friendly married man who surely had no further intentions. Seeing how he had interrupted his concentration to analyze his heart's argument, his heart had already won. 

Luke stopped, took two steps back, and turned towards the workshop's open door. "I'm sorry, I didn't see you there. Hello."

Vanth had pushed aside the incredible amount of useless crap that usually covered the worktable and had his right arm stretched across it, sleeve pushed up to his shoulder. Beside his arm laid a handful of tools and a small oil container. He had removed a panel on his forearm, revealing the interior mechanisms. Right. Maintenance. Luke had been told he had to do it every now and then, but in his Jedi wisdom had decided he'd do it every never and never.  

Vanth was looking at him with one of his signature grins. "Keep me company?" he asked, nodding at an empty stool.

Luke could've refused. He could've accepted and been nothing but a spectator. However, a tiny voice in his head said _Well, no time like the present_ with such conviction that he found himself removing his glove and placing his mech arm on the table. Vanth had no slick comment to make, which Luke was thankful for. He just pushed the screwdriver towards the Jedi and kept on working.

"So... You grew up in Tatooine?" Was Vanth trying to soothe him with small talk? Was he so obviously uncomfortable? 

Luke replied with a noncommittal hum.

"I really did think that Jedi were more of a Core planet thing." A soft chuckle. "In fact, I thought they were more of a Core planet _legend_ but hey, what do I know."

Luke couldn't help the sudden urge to open up more than just a panel on his arm. "Actually, I was a farmer. The Jedi thing came later."

Vanth paused his work for a moment to stare at Luke, which Luke did not appreciate considering his current vulnerable state. "Fascinating." And it kept getting worse. "But I'm guessing _that_ was no farming accident." And it kept. Getting. Worse. Vanth clearly expected Luke to reply, but after an awkward pause during which Luke refused to acknowledge anything that had been said, the former Marshal continued. "Mine was a simple blaster hit to the shoulder. If I hadn't been knocked over and we hadn't been in such a high-strung moment of crisis, slam, bang, a bacta patch and I'm good as new. But the time that passed, the infection... my nerves went to shit and the whole thing was useless." 

Luke now felt plain rude about being so quiet. He wanted to know how Vanth was so forthcoming about his cybernetics? Well, maybe he could start by not being such a cagey bastard. "Mine was cut off in battle." Vanth simply nodded, not pressing for any more details, so Luke couldn't understand why he added in a small voice, "By my father."

The breath that got stuck in Vanth's throat was deafening in the quiet workshop. "Kid..." 

Luke shook his head. No, no pity. No words fumbling to understand. He wasn't done talking, though. "I'm not used to talking about it," he mumbled. "Not my father." A humorless laugh. "I talk about that plenty with my sister." And with the man himself, or at least his spirit, but that was a bit too much for workshop small talk. "I mean this, specifically." A vague wave with the repair torch he had been using to repair an old blaster scuff. "I had never been somewhere where it is _acknowledged_, let alone discussed or flaunted—" He flinched. He hadn't meant that to come out so harsh. "Sorry, that's not fair, I—"

Vanth flexed his fingers, watching the mechanism through the open panel. "No, no worries, I certainly do flaunt it. It cost a pretty penny. It cost _Fett_, not me, but still..." He eyed Luke like they were sharing an inside joke. "Nothin' like a shiny trinket to win someone over, huh?" He placed his arm back on the table and replaced the panel. "And whenever you feel like talking about it, you can always come to me. I'd also suggest the Mods, but let's be honest here." This time, his eyes swept unashamedly across every inch of Luke that was visible above the table, and yup, Luke's ears were definitely burning now. "They'd eat you alive, farm boy."

Both of them knew that wasn't true, but Luke had no intention of arguing. It was truly refreshing to be treated like any other mortal for once. Vanth had such an incredible power of making him drop his guard with just his voice that Luke didn't mind being watched while he finished his maintenance. He was about to finish up when he decided he'd take Vanth's offer right now. "Does it ever... hurt?" he began hesitantly, but immediately added, stumbling over his words, "Not where it connects, I mean, but, uh... Never mind. It's silly." He had once considered it related to the Force, or, more likely, just his imagination, but either way, he regretted almost saying it out loud. 

"Like the hand you don't have is cramping?"

Luke raised his head from his work to look at Vanth, who was smiling, but there was no mockery in that smile. "Yeah. Or like something is pricking my palm."

Vanth nodded. "I get this tingling sensation from the tip of my thumb to my wrist every now and then. Drash once said she hadn't slept a wink the night before because she felt like someone was holding a lighter under her arm. No arm, no lighter, nothing she could do about it. Boy, she was _cranky_ that day." Vanth leaned back on his chair and drew out a long whistle. "And the itching!"

"The itching!" Luke agreed. He couldn't remember the last time he had smiled so widely, and all over such a strange topic of conversation. "How can it possibly itch?!"

Cobb shrugged and laughed. "Your guess is as good as mine."

As their laughter died down, Luke finished up and wiped the oil from his hand with a dirty rag Cobb had among his supplies. "Well... this definitely feels better," he said while flexing each finger.

"No shit," Cobb answered, rolling his eyes.

Luke stood up with a sigh. He didn't feel a need to run away nor a need to stay at all costs. The same natural flow that accompanied him elsewhere in the palace had finally settled with Cobb, too. Now, it was time for him to go back to his meditation. Later, they'd spend more time together whenever that was meant to happen. And with some luck, Luke wouldn't blush too much. "Thank you," he said, and there were so many things he was thanking him for, but he felt it was enough. By the way Cobb nodded, it was.

Right as he walked out the door, Cobb called, "Hey, you left your—"

"Yeah, yeah, it's fine." And he meant it. He even chuckled when he heard Cobb mutter, "Alright, free glove, I guess."

## Chapter 7
It became clear how attached he was getting to the place when he adopted a favorite spot for his morning meditations. It was on a plateau among the ridges that rose behind the palace. The twin sunrise looked spectacular from there, and just being out in the open on his home planet made inner peace come easy. 

The problem was that it was such a good spot that it made sense that Luke wasn't the only one who loved it. The fourth morning after he had discovered it, he sensed Fett approaching. He opened his eyes and watched as the bounty hunter came up the path, helmet under his arm, and visibly startle when he saw Luke perched on his rock.

Neither man moved as they waited for the other to state his case. Seeing as there was no case to be explained, the silence hung thick. Finally, Luke decided to venture a guess that might get him shot. "Here to see the sunrise?"

Fett squared his shoulders as if he were preparing for a fight. "Yeah," he replied drily. He turned towards the horizon and nothing else was said.

While Luke sat on his rock every morning to meditate, Fett's visits were not as often or as scheduled. Nevertheless, whenever he showed up, it was the same routine: they didn't speak or even acknowledge each other. It was through this silent agreement of mutual disregard that they were able to share the small plateau. Luke would never point out that Fett was practically meditating, too, and he didn't admit to himself that the bounty hunter's introspection soothed him, too.

---

Luke felt the man's presence before he heard the boots crunching on the sand. Fett stopped a few meters away, which was the first change to their routine. Usually, he'd walk all the way to the edge to have the best view, and where Luke could catch a glimpse of him if he peeked out of the corner of his eye. The change intrigued Luke, so he decided to poke at it to see how far it would go. "Yes?" he asked, turning his head towards Fett and stretching his legs out towards the edge of the cliff. 

"I thought you were in a call," Fett replied curtly. "Heard you talking to someone, or so I thought."

Oh. Right. That might explain the change in his behavior. "I..." Fett was clear about not caring about "_Jetii_ crap" and was very vocal about his dislike of certain Jedi of old. Better not to go into detail when it wasn't strictly necessary. "I guess you could say that, yes, but it's okay."

Order seemed to be restored, because Fett walked to his usual spot and was silent for a few beats, but then he looked down at Luke and said, "You really are making yourself at home, aren't you?"

Ah. Of course. Fett's patience had finally worn thin. Luke wasn't going to look for a fight. He had done what he had come to do: he had made amends. If it was time to leave, then so be it. When he turned to answer, he noticed that Fett was making a sour face.

"Well, that came out shitty," the bounty hunter muttered then tried again, "You seem happy here, Jedi." A pause. He sighed. "That also sounded like a threat, didn't it?"

"A bit, yeah," Luke answered, tilting his head. What was he possibly getting at?

Almost like he could read Luke's thoughts through the Force, Fett said, "I don't know what I'm doing here." With a grunt, he sat down next to Luke's rock, making the situation even more bizarre. "I didn't lie that first night. I hold no particular resentment towards you, specifically. Jedi in general, though... not my favorite people."

"I know," Luke said softly, and he did know. Obi-Wan had told him. 

Fett nodded, but it was hollow, as if he thought that Luke only saw it as a petty feud. "But still," he continued, "I may hate to say it, but you're alright, farm boy."

Luke felt his face warm up with thoughts of whatever circumstances and conversations led to Fett learning that particular fact about his past. "Cobb told you."

"Of course he told me," and Fett was smiling at him now, an honest, warm smile, like the one he had worn when welcoming Din, Cobb and Grogu into his home (before he spotted Luke, of course).

Pushing aside his musings of why Cobb was discussing him and his life with Fett, Luke turned away to stare at the imposing palace below. "That doesn't mean you own me, Daimyo," he grumbled, but there wasn't any real anger in his voice. Butting heads with Fett just made everything feel normal, instead of... whatever was going on. 

"Funny," Fett chuckled, "I used to say something similar to the Jedi and their Old Republic kin. Most of them still acted like I was escaped property, though." Luke wouldn't have called it "funny", and he had a mark on him lower back that agreed with him, but everyone dealt with their experiences differently. 

Something was shifting in the emotions that Fett was projecting, like he was circling a particular point but couldn't quite land yet. An uncomfortable silence fell as Fett continued to deliberate, until he finally chose his next words. "He's taken quite a liking to you. Cobb, that is."

Luke felt a blush climb up from his chest but he didn't react in any other way that Fett might notice.

The bounty hunter continued, "Well, the whole Djarin clan likes you, but for Din and the womp rat that was already a given. Grogu adores you, and he told Din all about it in whatever way the communicate, either on their own or through that new teacher of his. Cobb, on the other hand... these past rotations were your test, and you passed with flying colors, if the way he talks about you is anything to go by."

How _did_ he talk about him? _Like a faithful husband talking about a friend— no, an acquaintance— and the past mentor of his stepchild_, his brain answered. _How else?_ "That's, uh," he began, tongue-tied like a fool. "That's good to hear."

There was venomous mischief in Fett's voice when he added, "And you've taken quite a liking to Cobb as well."

Finally. The true purpose of this conversation. A man pouncing upon the little homewrecker trying to slither his way between his best friend and his best friend's husband. Or at least that's how Fett saw it. Luke may occasionally get angry at his thoughts when they betrayed him, but he still had honor and a fuckload of firm principles. "Listen, you can think what you want of me, Fett, but know that I would _never_ even consider coming between two people—"

And Fett laughed. Incomprehensibly, he laughed. "Stop squirming, farm boy!" Luke didn't stop squirming because he hadn't been squirming in the first place, but he did close his mouth to wait for a much needed explanation. Fett continued, "No wonder you hadn't made a move, you had no idea. I guess it is up to me to clue you in."

"Stop treating me like the innocent, young farmhands you trick into your bed," Luke bit back. He'd grown up around here. He'd heard the rumors. He'd bore witness to friends of friends of friends coming back after a night of their parents worrying themselves sick, all giggly and proud because a Daimyo had called upon them _specifically_ and would most definitely call them back at any moment for more permanent companionship, maybe even for their hand. It took either days, weeks or months depending on the person for them to come back to their senses and stop waiting.

That strange easy-going expression was gone from Fett's face, which made Luke very happy. "You know I'm not like that."

"Do I?"

"Would someone like Din think me worth their time if I was?"

Fuck. That was a good point. "He wouldn't give you the time of day," Luke admitted. 

Fett was starting to smile again, and Luke was starting to think that may not be such a strange occurrence when he wasn't in court or helmeted. "Exactly. Din is... Din is a very curious _Mando'ad_. He is..." As Fett's sentence drifted off, Luke watched as Fett turned his face towards the rising suns with an expression of increasing fondness, a very strong and unfiltered fondness that clogged the Force signature surrounding him. Oh.

Before Luke could finish connecting the dots lighting up in his head, Fett continued talking. "You and Din keep playing co-parents and then immediately switch to playacting the most professional and distant relationship you can muster. Cobb keeps peacocking around you and you bat your eyelashes, then panic and flee. And I..." Fett looked at Luke again like he was trying to find his next words in his eyes, and considering the turn their conversation had taken, this time Luke _was_ starting to squirm. "Well, maybe I will fit the stereotype this one time and bring a farm boy to our bed." Luke didn't have a chance to react when two of Fett's fingers swept a lock of golden hair away from his forehead. "Our bed. That the three of us share. In case you still weren't getting what I'm explaining."

Luke swallowed, willing himself to say something, anything. He wasn't a farm boy. He was a skilled warrior, a powerful Jedi. He was even trained in public speaking thanks to Leia. There had to be something he could do in response to that apart from blushing, stammering, and touching the spot on his forehead where he could still feel the brush of Boba's fingers. His mind was spinning so fast that Boba could've gotten up and left hours ago and he wouldn't have noticed.

"Take your time, kid. You don't need to answer right now." Oh, so he hadn't left and only seconds, not hours, had passed. But he was standing up now. And he was leaving. And he was gone.

"What was _that_ all about?"

If Luke squeaked slightly when the voice behind him startled him, it was only because his mind had finally reached its breaking point for the day. "You're still here?!" he demanded as he turned around.

Obi-Wan crossed his arms over his chest and raised an eyebrow. "Well, it's not like we got to finish _our_ conversation, Luke, and I never thought it was going to get so..."

"Personal?! Private?!"

His late master had the gall to roll his eyes. "So dramatic."

"It _was_ private, and I—" Luke made an aborted gesture with his hand. "I don't know. I don't know what I want. I mean..." He threw a sideways glance at the now empty path where Fett had walked away. "He _is_ handsome..."

"I can't deny that without being very hypocritical." When Luke stared at him with horror, Obi-Wan dismissed it with a wave of his hand. "Nothing, never mind, you've got a lot of thinking to do." And with that he vanished, leaving Luke alone with his thoughts, which was a terribly cruel thing for a master to do.

## Chapter 8
It would've been fine, anyway. Boba was in full armor; the shot would've maybe left a bruise or maybe a scrape if it managed to hit the spot between the breastplate and the pauldron in the worst case scenario. That one shot wouldn't have done any real damage, and there wouldn't be a second shot. Every guard in the throne room would've been on that sniveling _di'kut_ and his blaster in a matter of seconds, and even that would've been an overkill once Fennec put a bolt between his eyes.

The meeting had started out boring, then turned to plain annoying when the Zabrak trader had started grovelling. Some folks just can't deal with not getting what they want, and this man was one of them: a mess of pleas and attempted bargains that was grating on every single one of Boba's nerves. When Boba had had enough and gestured to have him removed from his sight, the idiot made the stupidest decision of his life.

He was quick to draw, sure, and his aim was decent enough that the shot was indeed heading in the right direction, but Boba didn't want to give him too much credit. After all, he wasn't that far away and he wasn't exactly a small target. Also... what the fuck was the trader's plan after that? Did he think that dying after shooting the most pathetic shot would make him some sort of martyr? If that was it, he wasn't getting it, because his death didn't come and his shot didn't land.

For the tiniest of milliseconds, Boba thought that adrenaline made time appear to slow down. Then he realized that the trader's hand was shaking at normal speed. The guards were moving at normal speed, too. They may have not jumped at the trader out of confusion, but they were circling him in case anything else happened. 

So it was only the blaster bolt that was frozen in time, floating halfway between the trader and Boba.

He appeared like a shadow out of the corner of Boba's field of vision. He was walking towards the center of the throne room leisurely. His right hand was cradling the cup of caf he was sipping. His left hand was raised in a tight fist. The twinkle in his blue eyes combined with his half smile was almost playful, but it still made a cold shiver run down Boba's spine. Once he was standing next to the Zabrak, he stopped. And then the bolt started moving. In reverse.

In his panic, the trader had dropped his blaster. It was a good thing he was already on his knees for his grovelling, because with the way he was trembling it was unlikely he would've been able to hold himself up. As the bolt he had fired started making its way back towards his body, all he did was watch with a wobbling lip. It was moving so slowly it would've been an agonizing death, the unrelenting plasma inching into his forehead, which had ended up right in its path when the Zabrak had crumbled slightly after shooting. Lucky for him, it stopped once again right before its target, the only damage being one of his horns blackening slightly in the proximity of the bolt. 

Luke squatted down next to him, fist still raised. With hot breath that probably smelt of caf and confidence caressing the trader's cheek, he whispered a single word that echoed around the silent throne room: "Leave." The Zabrak immediately scrambled backwards and then to his feet, and the guards, still in shock, did not stop him as he bolted out the door. Eh. He'd get himself killed soon enough.

Taking another relaxed sip from his cup, Luke stood up and turned towards Boba. "Can we talk? In private, preferably?"

Boba refrained from mentioning he didn't care if they did it privately or not, but what he had in mind didn't involve a lot of talking. Fennec would be in a pissy mood all week if he did, and he wasn't ready for gossip to spread and all of Tatooine to think things of him and the Jedi. Instead, he nodded towards the backrooms, stood up, and left, knowing that Luke would be right behind him. As he left, he noticed for the first time that Din and Cobb were standing by the door Luke had entered through, and had probably arrived with the Jedi. When he walked past them, Cobb touched his shoulder and muttered, "Is it just me, or did this just make anyone else's top 10 hottest things they've ever seen?" Boba replied with a chuckle, and Din with a soft huff. "Three out of three, then. This is going to work out peachy."
