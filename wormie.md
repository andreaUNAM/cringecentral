# You can't plant me in your penthouse (I'm going back to my plough)
## Chapter 1
She found him staring at a wall. Someone else, someone not in tune with the Force, would've reverently called it "meditating" and would've walked away quietly. But she could feel the churning emotions; he was upset, frustrated, and not even trying to meditate. Just staring at the stone wall of the small circular hut. No sense pretending she might distract him. "There you are, Skykid!" she exclaimed and ruffled his hair before sitting down on the ground in front of him.

"Ahsoka," Luke all but whined, "you interrupted me, I was..." She raised her eyebrow, and Luke trailed off, lowering his eyes.

"You can meditate peacefully, you can meditate angrily, but you have to have the intent of meditating." It was an odd relationship: not quite master and padwan, not quite equals. She had met him as a grown man—the saviour of the Galaxy, not just any grown man—and yet she sometimes saw him as a little boy her Master had left in her care.

"Hm. Yeah." The answer was noncommittal. He did not like being seen as a little boy.

Ahsoka sighed. "Alright. What's bothering you?"

"What do you think?"

"Again?"

"Always."

"He made his own choice."

"He's a _baby_, Ahsoka, of course he chose his father." Luke uncrossed his legs and bent them to the left, tucking them under his body. Less Jedi, more Luke. "I was afraid of uncertainty and stuck to a tradition I said I was going to change. I was wrong in making him choose." He finally looked away from the dusty ground to give Ahsoka a sideways glance. "And I know you agree that I was wrong."

Ahsoka shifted uncomfortably. She had been enjoying pretending neutrality. "Skykid..." she began, gently handpicking her words, "Luke. I kept the Mandalorian away so you wouldn't get thrown off your rhythm. As for the rest... I was not expecting it. And I wasn't expecting you to follow through."

"I made a commitment, Ahsoka. A stupid one, but a commitment nonetheless. I couldn't go back on my word."

"Proud," Ahsoka smirked, and Luke's mouth twisted into a tiny petulant frown. 

They stayed like that for a while, listening to the sounds of wildlife beyond the hut and the comfortable silence inside the hut. Luke traced patterns in the dirt, and Ahsoka watched him as she felt his foul mood untangle and begin to relax. When he spoke again, his voice was much lighter.

"It was a cute shirt, though."

"It was a _really_ cute shirt," Ahsoka agreed with a laugh.

Luke nimbly jumped to his feet. "I'm going to have to leave you for a little bit," and then added with sharp irony, "It's not like any of my many students are going to miss me." The silence of the empty school answered him.

Choosing to ignore the latter, Ahsoka stood up, too, and asked, "Where are you going to go?"

Luke's blue eyes were steeled with resolution. "Luke Skywalker does not abandon a student."

## Chapter 2
His only lead pointed to Tatooine. Of course it was Tatooine. It was always Tatooine.

"You told me someone recognized him at the hangar where you arrived, right?" R2 chirped an affirmative. "Great. Take me to the same one, I'll start asking there." 

Luke had changed out of his black robes. As much as he loved his new style, he knew how unforgiving his home's suns could be. The new brown ones were more fitted and more stylish than anything he had worn back in his Tatooine days, and the black glove on his right hand was a stark reminder of the time that had passed. But he still felt younger, a foolish little boy shuffling back home to fix his mistakes.

Waving one last goodbye to Ahsoka, his pulled his X-Wing into the sky.

Luke could see the woman's lips moving before he landed, and he caught her mid explanation when he opened the cockpit. "— I keep telling them I need my papers in order, officer, they just won't listen. You gotta understand. Let me fix you to a spot of spotchka for the trip back, and maybe a little something else—" R2's beeps informed him that this was not the first time this woman was _just_ about to get her papers in order. "Hey, I know you!" the woman exclaimed, "You are the little bad-mouthed droid that dropped the kid off." Her eyes narrowed when she turned to Luke. "If he's your droid, you've got some explaining to do. About sending the kid out on his own. Not the bad mouth. I've heard worse."

Great. His ship had barely touched the ground and he was already being told off like the boy who didn't close the eopie pen. "Yes, he... I'm looking for him. Can you help me?"

The woman laughed with her whole body. "Oh, I see. You didn't send him off on his own, the little womp rat escaped! And stole an X-Wing! Boy, it sure did take you a while to track him down." She pointed at R2 accusingly. "The droid was in on it, you know."

Now, wouldn't that be easy. Just to nod along and laugh. The kid had escaped! Luke had been worried sick! No one had clung to ill-interpreted rules about attachments like a safety blanket! What a simple and dishonorable solution that would be. "No," he replied solemnly. "I did send him off. I was wrong. I want to see him again. I want to, no, I _have_ to apologize."

He was expecting the woman to tell him off again and then kick him out of her hangar, but the small smile on her lips showed understanding. "Park that thing out of the way. If you can cover it, better. Don't want any customers being spooked by the idea of nearby cops." As Luke cruised to a roofed section of the hangar, the woman walked next to the ship and kept talking. "You are in luck, kid. He's been out and about with his dad, but every now and then they'll stop here for a breather, and they're scheduled to arrive today. They stay for a while, so you'll have plenty of time for your apology."

Force. That was fast. So very, very fast. And his father was going to be with him (of course his father was going to be with him), he was going to get his ass kicked by a Mandalorian. He was going to _let_ a Mandalorian kick his ass; he believed he had it in him to hold his own, but he didn't think he should. Not after how stupid he had been. The X-Wing was parked and covered. He wanted to crawl under the tarp, too.

"Will you stop fidgeting over there? Help me with these boxes! I'm not running a leisure resort here, do something if you're going to be hanging around."

He lifted the boxes directly with his hands and even pretended to struggle a bit. Either the woman was being discreet (seemed unlikely) or she truly had not recognized him. Either way, he didn't want to draw any attention. 

## Chapter 3
By the time the ship arrived, the boxes had long been moved, emptied, and moved again. Luke was sitting on top of them, his feet dangling without touching the ground. It was the first ship that had arrived after his own, but he had no way of knowing if it was the one he was waiting for.

The first person to walk out of it made him think that it was not, because he was a stranger. He swaggered towards Luke, thumb hooked on a lopsided belt. "You hired a helper, Peli?" the stranger asked towards him, but not at him. He eyed Luke up and down intensely, and Luke quickly did the same even though it was not necessary to asses the situation. The stranger was handsome, handsome enough to make Luke's stomach flip. He also seemed to be about twice his age, and that was a can of worms Luke constantly chose _not_ to open. There was a symbol on his belt buckle that Luke swore he had seen before, but couldn't place where. 

Even with the initial question, it wasn't certain that the stranger hadn't recognized him. Judging by the intensity of his gaze, if he had, Luke would have to brace himself for a fight. His fingers twitched over his lightsaber through the robe. 

"What's your name, kid?"

Luke reached out through the Force and found only honesty. Not recognized once again. Blessed anonymity, he might just end up liking being here after all. "Luke," he answered simply. A bit of a risk, but it made the anonymity taste even sweeter when the stranger did not react.

"Well, Luke, are you Peli's new helper or not?"

The woman (Peli, apparently, she hadn't shared her name with Luke before) replied for him. "Please. Like I'd hire some fancy-looking offworlder." Strangely, the remark stung. "He's just here waiting for— Ah, speak of the devil!"

The Mandalorian shone in the Tatooine suns. There was an energy to him, like all the noise in the galaxy suddenly stopped and tuned themselves to his beat, to draw everything in, to make him the center of it all. And there was that symbol, right over his shoulder. And in his arms... oh, there he was. Luke's heart fluttered when he felt the Force signature of the sleeping child mix with his own. "Jedi," was all the Mandalorian said, and Luke saw the stranger's eyebrows rise.

"Hello again," Luke greeted as he stood up, controlling his tone. He might feel like a foolish little boy, but had enough pride to at least appear calm and professional. 

No one else said anything until the stranger cleared his throat. "Uh, alright. I, uh, thought we had already gone through the introductions, but I'm gonna need a bit more information here, please."

"Right." With the hand not cradling Grogu, the Mandalorian gestured towards Luke. "This is Luke Skywalker, Grogu's first Jedi teacher." First. That meant there was a second. Or more. "This," he placed a hand on the stranger's shoulder, "is Cobb Vanth, former Marshal of Freetown, formerly Mos Pelgo."

Vanth gave Luke his hand to shake. "Also his husband, by the way, dunno why he left _that_ out." Oh, fantastic. The man he had been drooling over was his former student's stepfather. Excellent. 

There was a deep fondness in his voice and the energy coming from him when the Mandalorian said, "I'm still not used to saying it, specially not in Basic, _cyar'ika_."

The Mandalorian's fondness was matched by the warmth in Vanth's eyes when he turned to look at him. "I'm still not used to being it, sweetheart."

Luke all of a sudden felt very alone in the great expanse of the Galaxy. He decided to change the subject to even more painful waters. "I've come to apologize, Mandalorian." The Mandalorian's only reply was a hum in the back of his throat, so Luke continued, "Your child shouldn't have to choose between his father and his path as a Jedi. I made a mistake." _This is Luke Skywalker, Grogu's_ first _Jedi teacher._ "I understand that the position to teach the child is no longer open—"

"It's not."

"—and I understand, but I still needed to apologize."

The Mandalorian just stared at him for what seemed like ages. Vanth had moved away with Peli to give them some space, so it was just a one on one staring contest. Did Mandalorian armor shield the user from being probed by the Force? No, that was stupid. Luke was just making excuses for the fact that he wasn't really trying to sense the Mandalorian's emotions, afraid of what he might find. 

Finally: "Okay." And the Mandalorian turned around a walked towards a waiting speeder.

As Luke stood there, dumbfounded, he felt Vanth's laugh stir the hairs on his neck as he walked up from behind him. "That means he accepts your apology, and it's getting quite late, so won't you join us for dinner?" He placed a hand on the small of Luke's back (it was a testament to his training that he didn't jump at the sudden touch) and led him towards the speeder. 

"It didn't mean all of that," the Mandalorian grumbled as he tucked Grogu in a makeshift bed on the front row of the speeder's seats.

"Now don't be so rude, darling," his husband chided. "The kid came here from who knows what side of the Galaxy to talk to you and you are going to leave him alone in an unknown planet?"

Luke cleared his throat, "Uh, actually, I grew up in Tatooine."

"Huh. Well, I'll be damned," Vanth exclaimed with raised eyebrows. "I didn't know we had some fancy Jedi palace hiding somewhere in our dirtball." He patted Luke on the shoulder and hopped onto the copilot seat. Luke decided he wasn't going to correct him, and he silently climbed onto the back seat.

## Chapter 4
When they drove out of town and into the waiting desert, Luke asked where they were going. Vanth explained that they had a "small place" (the Mandalorian chuckled here) where they liked to lay low and rest when they were on Tatooine. He would go visit his town in the morning, but Din and Grogu would stay there as long as they remained on the planet.

Din. The Mandalorian had a name.

At one point during the ride, Grogu woke up and peeked over the seat. When his eyes confirmed what he had sensed through the Force, his ears perked up. "Hey there, little one," Luke greeted, and the kid cooed in reply. 

"Sit down, Grogu, or you'll fly right off," the Mandalorian—Din—said. There was no resentment in his voice, but the modulator in his helmet could be concealing it. Luke decided he was going to look at the rolling dunes instead.

---

He had been uneasy with the situation the entire time, but his anxiety rose when horribly familiar towers appeared in the horizon. They seemed to be riding straight for them, and it's not like there were other places around they could be heading towards. Maybe there was still time to make a turn, for their course to point them elsewhere. Luke held his breath, waiting.

But Din's steering never changed. 

So. Time to asses. Working theory: The Mandalorian had no intention of forgiving him, maybe even knew he was coming. Everyone else had pretended not to recognize him. They knew of his run-in with the Hutts and were about to collect a hefty sum for bringing him to whoever had taken Jabba's place. These were, after all, a bounty hunter, a stranger... and a child. Well. It was still a working theory, after all. 

"Where," he repeated tensely, his fingers wrapping around his lightsaber, "are we going?"

Everyone on the front seat seemed confused by his change in demeanor, which was a good sign. Or a shitty move, to keep feigning ignorance. Grogu pulled himself up again and tilted his head quizzically. Din looked away from the road (or at least his helmet turned to the side, his eyes could still be facing forwards) and replied, "The same place we were going last time you asked." Vanth just stared at him blankly, but Luke could tell his hand moved towards his holster, although that could be a precaution to protect his family. 

"I believe," the former Marshal began carefully, "that our friend recognizes the ex-Hutt palace and it is not the family resort he had in mind. I can assure you: you will be safe. You have nothing to worry about."

"Ex-Hutt?"

"Yes, a woman we know only as the Hutt Slayer—"

"I'm familiar with the story of Jabba's demise."

"Well, after the old slug croaked, there's been a couple of changes in management, and the man in charge now... he's a good man." As a sign of good will, Vanth added with a friendly smirk, "Just don't say it to his face, he'll throw a fit. He has this whole persona in his mind."

Luke could feel Grogu watching him. Grogu. He could trust Grogu. And from what he had gathered from his first meeting with Din, there was no deception between the pair, so if he could trust Grogu, he could trust Din. Vanth... Even if he was playing a long con, if shit hit the fan and he turned, he would be turning against Din, too, and the resulting fight— It didn't matter, it seemed very unlikely. The way they looked at each other... not something that can be pretended. 

He let go of his lightsaber and relaxed in his seat. "Alright. Sorry."

"No worries, partner," Vanth beamed.

"We've all been there," Din agreed.

## Chapter 5
They couldn't possibly mean _him_. Surely, between their visits of Tatooine, there had been yet another "change in management" and _this man_ had taken over. And yet no one but Luke reacted as the hangar door slid open, revealing the man in green armor. He had his helmet under his arm and a warm smile on his face, but his expression soured when his eyes met Luke's. At least the feeling was mutual.

"You brought me a prisoner as a present?" was the bounty hunter's greeting, and Luke's nerves were once again on edge.

"Kriff, Fett, you are going to spook him," Din growled as he killed the speeder's engine.

"We found a stray and brought him over for dinner, can you show some manners?" Vanth seconded. "And I just gave him my word that he'd have nothing to worry about here, don't make me look bad."

Boba Fett's cold stare remained on Luke as the Jedi got off the speeder, even as he put his helmet back on. "You should've called ahead so I'd have an extra plate at my table. Only the best for Lord _Jetii_, the man who threw me into the pit."

Judging by how close Din, Vanth, and Fett seemed to be, Luke expected the former two to have a significant reaction to such an accusation, but Vanth just rolled his eyes. "Yeah, yeah, you've told us a thousand times before, and if you want you can tell us again over dinner, after I've gone to the fresher." He patted Fett's shoulder and walked into the palace like he owned the place.

Din finished unloading some bags from the speeder before lifting Grogu out and immediately placing him back down on the hangar floor to wander about freely, and if _that_ wasn't definite proof of the amount of trust he had on the other bounty hunter, Force knows what was. "Don't forget to say hi to Boba," he instructed distractedly, as if the child wasn't already on his way to some palace adventure. Din, on the other hand, did not forget to say hi to Boba. The two Mandalorian's clasped their hands and pulled each other close, pressing helmeted forehead against helmeted forehead. Luke barely managed to hear Din whisper, "Please behave," before they separated and started walking into the palace.

Luke shuffled behind them, feeling more and more out of place.

---

Everything was so eerily quiet. They didn't run into anyone as they made their way deep into the palace, no teams of bounty hunters, no Twi'lek dancers, no servants, no guards. Fett caught on to the way Luke was scanning the empty hallways and gruffly explained, "I don't need as much staff as the past idiots did. A handful of trusted friends and fighters is always better than a legion of potential traitors. And I think I've finally outgrown what used to pass as _entertainment_ in these places." 

Despite the clear disgust in Fett's voice in that last statement, Luke's jaw tightened. "_Entertainment_ like my sister?"

Fett's helmet impeded Luke from seeing the surprise on his face, but way his steps faltered gave it away. "That was your sister?"

Luke decided he was done with the small talk, lowering his hood and putting his hands up his sleeves. If Vanth had been with them instead of getting a head start, he would've probably tried to ease the tension with a joke and smirk. His husband, on the other hand, was silent as was his custom, which Luke preferred at the moment. This way he could process his mixed feelings about Fett, the situation, and the fact that he was apparently memorizing the mannerisms of not one, but two married men.

--- 

Tensions had thankfully eased by dinnertime. Luke still felt like an intruder, but at least the situation relaxed as such an odd collection of people gathered for what can only be called a family dinner. When they had arrived at the dining room (which was much more modest than Luke had expected it to be), there was already a woman clad in leather with a long black braid sitting on the seat to the right of the head of the table. She eyed the incoming party with an unchanging serious expression, but Luke could sense that only he was unwelcome. She also gave him the feeling that she already knew who he was, the serial number of his X-Wing's engine, the address of the small apartment in Coruscant he used when he visited Leia, and the exact date his nephew was due to be born.

Vanth joined them almost immediately, having found Grogu on his way. The two finally added some chatter to the previously silent room. The former Marshal was the one who ushered Luke to sit opposite to Fett, which was both a relief considering it was the farthest seat from him, and a cause for unease because it made him feel caught right in the bounty hunter's crosshair.

Just as a their dinner was brought forward by a droid (an 8D-series, for some bizarre reason), the last two members of their party arrived. 

"Sorry, sorry, game ran longer than expected," the young woman said as she slipped into her chair, and her companion kicked his chair back before sprawling on it. Fett just eyed them with a raised eyebrow, and Luke got the strangest recollection of Uncle Owen looking at him similarly the one and only time he had missed curfew after being dragged into a dingy cantina by Biggs.

The man's cybernetics were the most obvious ones. Of course, a modification as drastic as an eye was often hard to hide, but he didn't seem to _want_ to hide it. And the woman... her left arm, bright red and uncovered. And Luke hadn't failed to notice that Vanth's right arm was also cybernetic, and he also wore it uncovered and with that stupidly attractive confidence. His gloved hand clenched around his fork, the creak of the leather concealing the whir of the mechanism. How did they do it?

With her mouth full of stew, the woman with the cybernetic arm interrupted Luke's thoughts, whatever quiet conversation Vanth and the woman with the braid were having, and the soft coos between Grogu and Din as the latter convinced the former to eat his vegetables. "So, is anyone going to explain who the new guy is?"

Surprisingly, Fett was the one to answer. "Just some punk who likes going around doing silly little backflips, slicing people's blasters, and getting them thrown into monster's maws." Even more surprising, his tone was light and playful. Somehow, it almost made sense. After all, he had allowed Luke to enter his palace and join them for a very intimate dinner. The reason was still wildly unclear, but it appeared that his resentment was not too sharp.

This was clearly not just a dinner with close friends but a dinner with insane people, for the woman's only reply was a quiet "Huh" and a nod. Luke must've had his confusion written on his face because Fett continued, "Kid, it was me or you, and you fought to make sure it wasn't you. Nothing wrong with that. There were plenty of other people there that day that I resent much more than you." He fished a piece of meat from his stew and pointed the fork at Luke. "Like Solo. Fuck Solo." As he chewed his meat, the attention of every adult in the room did not waver away from him (Grogu was poking down the solids in his stew just to watch them float up again). "You've also got a good word for you put in by Djarin and his clan, and that is something I do not take lightly."

Din nodded solemnly. Grogu blew a raspberry at a piece of potato. Vanth caught Luke's eye and winked. 

Luke had to take a beat to control his fluster. "I am thankful, lord Fett, although I cannot say I have earned their good word. I made a mistake, and I abandoned my student dishonorably."

Despite the helmet between them, Din's gaze was piercing. "You're here now, aren't you?"

## Chapter 6
